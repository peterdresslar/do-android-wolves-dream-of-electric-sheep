            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support the wolf population while being mindful of the declining sheep numbers. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is vital for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two species."
