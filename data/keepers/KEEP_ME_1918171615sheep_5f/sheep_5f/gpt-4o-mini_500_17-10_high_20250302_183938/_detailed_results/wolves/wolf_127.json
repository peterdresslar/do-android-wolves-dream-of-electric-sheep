            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also being cautious about the wolf population growth. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without causing sudden crashes.",

With the wolf population also being relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover.
