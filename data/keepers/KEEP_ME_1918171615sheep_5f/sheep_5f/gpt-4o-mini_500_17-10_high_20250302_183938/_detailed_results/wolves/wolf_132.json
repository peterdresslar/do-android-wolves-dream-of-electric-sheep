            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for increased hunting without immediate risk of depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, and I want to ensure sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the current low wolf population and the concerning trend in sheep numbers, a moderate approach is necessary to ensure sustainability and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the current low wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, a moderate increase is prudent to ensure we do not overhunt and can maintain our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that I can increase my hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes to ensure the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. A moderate increase allows for sustainable growth while keeping an eye on the dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can thrive, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our wolf population. A moderate theta will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 2.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests that focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
