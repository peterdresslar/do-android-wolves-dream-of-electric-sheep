A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling our pack to thrive.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence."
