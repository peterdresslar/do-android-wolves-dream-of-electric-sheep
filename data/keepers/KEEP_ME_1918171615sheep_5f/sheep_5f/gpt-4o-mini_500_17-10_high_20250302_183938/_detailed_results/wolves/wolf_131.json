            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, a balanced approach is necessary to ensure both populations can thrive. This moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious about depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainable cycles. However, given the current low wolf population, I want to avoid drastic changes that could destabilize our numbers. A gradual approach allows us to adapt to the ecosystem"
