            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species."
