            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. While I need to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to regain numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
