This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still ensuring the sheep have a chance to thrive. This balance will help sustain both populations in the long run."
