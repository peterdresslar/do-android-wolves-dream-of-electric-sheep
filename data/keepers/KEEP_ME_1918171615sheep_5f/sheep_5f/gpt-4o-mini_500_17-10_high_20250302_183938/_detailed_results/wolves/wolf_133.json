            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population is low, I want to ensure we maintain a balance that supports our growth while being cautious of the sheep numbers. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help us capitalize on the current conditions without jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for moderate hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for wolf population growth. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting intensity and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence and gives the sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability."
