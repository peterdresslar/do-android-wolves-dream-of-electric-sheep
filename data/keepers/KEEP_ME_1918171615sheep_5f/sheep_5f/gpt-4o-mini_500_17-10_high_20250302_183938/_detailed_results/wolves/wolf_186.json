A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous focus on competition with other wolves has not allowed for sustainable hunting. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to support reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current ecosystem state while considering the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
