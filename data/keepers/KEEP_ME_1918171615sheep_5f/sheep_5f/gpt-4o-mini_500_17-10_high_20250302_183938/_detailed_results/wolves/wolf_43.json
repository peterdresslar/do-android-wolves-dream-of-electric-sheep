            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep to recover from their depleted state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. With a high wolf population, it is essential to reduce hunting intensity to prevent further depletion of the sheep and ensure long-term sustainability."
