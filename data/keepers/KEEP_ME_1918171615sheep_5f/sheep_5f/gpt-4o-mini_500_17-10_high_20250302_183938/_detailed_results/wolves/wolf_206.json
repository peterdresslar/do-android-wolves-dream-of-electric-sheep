            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, a cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. This moderate theta value balances the need for hunting with the importance of sustaining the sheep population for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. However, the high sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to maintain our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
