            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and prioritizing long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. By increasing theta slightly to 0.30, I can begin to balance my hunting efforts while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem."
