            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting approach to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.96, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and it would be wise to focus on allowing their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting to support the wolf population while prioritizing the long-term health of the sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and responding to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.04, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity.

A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. It also allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.79, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep and can sustain both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.32, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover.
