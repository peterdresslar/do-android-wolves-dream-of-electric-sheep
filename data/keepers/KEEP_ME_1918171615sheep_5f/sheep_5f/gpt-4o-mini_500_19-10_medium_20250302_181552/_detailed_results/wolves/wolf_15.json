            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 26\n- Sheep population: 123.78\n- Wolf population: 10.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.076\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 12.38 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.4% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low. To allow the sheep to recover while still focusing on competition with other wolves, a slight increase to 0.25 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 7.00. This indicates that while there is potential for sheep recovery, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some competition among wolves."
