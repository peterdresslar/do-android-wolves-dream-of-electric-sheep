            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.01, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, jeopardizing both their survival and our own in the long term. By maintaining a low theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.1 was too focused on competition with other wolves. By increasing theta slightly to 0.2, I can begin to hunt more effectively while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the wolf population recover while still allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This small adjustment aligns with the need for balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also keeping an eye on the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
