            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.1% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep. A gradual increase is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a collapse.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By increasing my theta slightly to 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
