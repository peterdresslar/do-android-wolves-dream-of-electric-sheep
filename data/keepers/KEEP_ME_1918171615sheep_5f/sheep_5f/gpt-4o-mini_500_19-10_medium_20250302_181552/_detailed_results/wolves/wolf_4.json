            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.04, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can replenish their numbers, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.30, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep can recover if we reduce our hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling the sheep to gradually increase in number, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.79, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.48, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence while still considering the trends in both populations."
