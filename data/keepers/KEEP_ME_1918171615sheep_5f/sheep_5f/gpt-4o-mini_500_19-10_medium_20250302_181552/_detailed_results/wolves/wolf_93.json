A lower theta will help prevent further depletion of the sheep population while we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help us avoid depleting the sheep further while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. Gradual adjustments are key, and maintaining a lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.200. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting pressure, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.25. This small adjustment will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population recover while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.300 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.15, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
