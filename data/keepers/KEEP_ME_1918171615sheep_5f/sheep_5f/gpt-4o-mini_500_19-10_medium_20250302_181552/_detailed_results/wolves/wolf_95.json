            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for recovery, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will allow the sheep to gradually increase in number while ensuring that the wolf population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.75, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential for overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.15, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By increasing my theta slightly to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.89, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.33, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.80, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can help maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.33, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.91, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual adjustment towards more hunting as the sheep population stabilizes, while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species."
