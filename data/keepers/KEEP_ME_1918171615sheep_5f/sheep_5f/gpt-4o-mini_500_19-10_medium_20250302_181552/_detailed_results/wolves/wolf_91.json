            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a sustainable balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.06, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the sheep"
