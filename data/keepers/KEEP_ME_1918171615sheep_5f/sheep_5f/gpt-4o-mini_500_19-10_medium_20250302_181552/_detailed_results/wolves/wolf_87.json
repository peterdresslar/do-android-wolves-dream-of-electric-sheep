            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta is necessary, but for now, a lower value will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.200 was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can begin to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of only 0.27, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. Sudden increases in hunting could lead to further depletion of the sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well."
