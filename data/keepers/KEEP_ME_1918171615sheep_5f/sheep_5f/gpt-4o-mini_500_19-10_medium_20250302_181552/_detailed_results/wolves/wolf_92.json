            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.06, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.29, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is also low. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help ensure a sustainable balance."
