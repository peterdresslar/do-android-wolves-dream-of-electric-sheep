            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can help maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
