This will help maintain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially as their numbers are still relatively low compared to the maximum capacity.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 136.46, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf population growth while still allowing sheep to recover."
