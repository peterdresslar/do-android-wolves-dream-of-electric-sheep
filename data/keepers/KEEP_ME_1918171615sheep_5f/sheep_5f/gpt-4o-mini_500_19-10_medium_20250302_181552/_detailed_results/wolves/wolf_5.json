            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.04, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus more on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.48, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.34, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will support our needs without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
