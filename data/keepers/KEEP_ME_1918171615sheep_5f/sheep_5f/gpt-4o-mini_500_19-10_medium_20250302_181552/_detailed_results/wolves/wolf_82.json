            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf pack to maintain its health. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.75, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting would further deplete the sheep, risking the long-term survival of both species. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover."
