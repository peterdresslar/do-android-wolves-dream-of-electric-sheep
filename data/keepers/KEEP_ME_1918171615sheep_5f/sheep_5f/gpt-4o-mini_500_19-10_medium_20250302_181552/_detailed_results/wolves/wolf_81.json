            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 73, which is only 7.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to gradually increase hunting intensity to support reproduction. A theta of 0.70 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competing with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, which is essential for long-term sustainability. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to avoid further depletion of the sheep population while still maintaining a healthy wolf community."
