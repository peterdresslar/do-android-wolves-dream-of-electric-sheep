This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
