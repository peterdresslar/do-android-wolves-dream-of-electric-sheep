            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also addressing the growing wolf population. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.07, which is 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help the sheep population gradually increase while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.18, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 17, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A gradual increase in theta can be considered if the sheep population begins to rise."
