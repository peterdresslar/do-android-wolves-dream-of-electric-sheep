            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 124.91, which is only 12.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 13.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt effectively while also considering the long-term health of both the sheep and wolf populations. This adjustment reflects the need to gradually increase hunting intensity as the sheep population is still relatively low, while also being cautious not to over-deplete their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (14.7% of maximum capacity), which suggests that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to allow for their recovery. While my previous theta of 0.55 was sustainable, a slight reduction to 0.45 will help balance the needs of both the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival without depleting the sheep further."
