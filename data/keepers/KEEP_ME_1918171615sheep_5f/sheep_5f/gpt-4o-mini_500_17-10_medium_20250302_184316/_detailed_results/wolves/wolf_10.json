            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.0% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.138. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity, I will gradually increase theta to 0.25. This approach balances the need for wolf survival with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.8% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 116.87, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly."
