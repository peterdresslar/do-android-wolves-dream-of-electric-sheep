            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.88, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.96, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current state of the ecosystem and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.47, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.29, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, I also need to consider the growing wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.36, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 5.67. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased gradually, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.62, which is only 3.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep."
