            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence while still recognizing the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.96, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 3.04. This indicates that while I need to maintain some hunting to support the wolf population, I should be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles."
