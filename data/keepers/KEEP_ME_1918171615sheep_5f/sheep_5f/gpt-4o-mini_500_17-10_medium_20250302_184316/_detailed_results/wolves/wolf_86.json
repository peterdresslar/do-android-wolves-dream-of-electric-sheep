            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the survival of my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
