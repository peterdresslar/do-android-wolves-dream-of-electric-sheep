            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 27\n- Sheep population: 124.91\n- Wolf population: 8.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.128\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 15.61 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 12.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.128. Increasing to 0.3 allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain the sheep population while also considering the growth of the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 132.39, which is only 13.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can begin to take advantage of the available resources while still allowing for sustainable coexistence. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and supports the long-term survival of both species."
