            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By adopting a moderate approach, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still keeping an eye on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep while allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very low at 3.31, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 14, I need to slightly increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolves can sustain themselves without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a cautious approach to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. While my previous theta was 0.300, a slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest hunting intensity that can help sustain my pack without further depleting the sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting gradually to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.15, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.55, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.13, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population."
