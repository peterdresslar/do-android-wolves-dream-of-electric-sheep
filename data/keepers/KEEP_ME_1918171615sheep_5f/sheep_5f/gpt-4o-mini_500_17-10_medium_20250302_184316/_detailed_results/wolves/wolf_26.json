            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 31\n- Sheep population: 146.58\n- Wolf population: 23.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.247\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 6.37 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 14.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.247. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still being cautious not to overhunt. This moderate increase will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.4% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, promoting sustainability while also considering the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also addressing competition with other wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species."
