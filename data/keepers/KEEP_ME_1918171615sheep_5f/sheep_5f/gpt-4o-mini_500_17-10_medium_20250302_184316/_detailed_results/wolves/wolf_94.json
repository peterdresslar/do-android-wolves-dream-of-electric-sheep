            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help sustain both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.45, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.15, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
