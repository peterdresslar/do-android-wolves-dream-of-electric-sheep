            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 1\n- Sheep population: 17.88\n- Wolf population: 10.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.500\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.79 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.88, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also helps to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring that wolves can thrive in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.96, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and ensuring long-term sustainability."
