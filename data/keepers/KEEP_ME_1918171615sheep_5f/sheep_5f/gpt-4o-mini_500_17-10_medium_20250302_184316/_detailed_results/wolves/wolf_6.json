To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.27, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
