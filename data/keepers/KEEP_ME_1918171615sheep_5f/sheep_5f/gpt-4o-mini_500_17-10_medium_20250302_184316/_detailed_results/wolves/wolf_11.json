            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively low at 8, I want to avoid over-hunting and maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is recovering, I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued reproduction among wolves while still maintaining a healthy sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources. Gradually adjusting to a more moderate hunting intensity will also help us adapt to the current wolf population and avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, reducing the risk of depleting the sheep population further while still enabling the wolf pack to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability."
