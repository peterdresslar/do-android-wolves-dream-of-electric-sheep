            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.19, which is only 4.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting and ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.07, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.18, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population more sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
