            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep resources while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 93.74, which is only 9.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can increase our hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, we must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both our needs and the recovery of the sheep population."
