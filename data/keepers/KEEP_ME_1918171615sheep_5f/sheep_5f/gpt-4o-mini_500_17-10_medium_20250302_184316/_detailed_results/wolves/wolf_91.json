            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. A lower theta will allow the sheep to replenish while still enabling some competition among wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
