            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 68.37, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. By maintaining a balance, I can support both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.99, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
