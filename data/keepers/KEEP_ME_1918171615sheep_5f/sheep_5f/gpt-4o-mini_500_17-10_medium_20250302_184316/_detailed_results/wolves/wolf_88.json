            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 38\n- Sheep population: 29.15\n- Wolf population: 93.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.138\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.31 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.9% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.15, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.25 reflects a focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual recovery of the sheep population and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting."
