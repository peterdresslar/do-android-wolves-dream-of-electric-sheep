However, with fewer wolves around, I need to balance my intensity to ensure I can catch enough prey while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 20.99 sheep and 7 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance allows me to survive without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves hasn't increased recently."
