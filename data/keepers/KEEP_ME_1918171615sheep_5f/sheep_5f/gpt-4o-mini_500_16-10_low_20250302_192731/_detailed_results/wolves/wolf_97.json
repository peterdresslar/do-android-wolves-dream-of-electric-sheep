            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant food while still being cautious about the risks of overexertion in a competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while also not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This way, I can adapt to the competition and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population hasn",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer and adapt to the changing dynamics of our environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
