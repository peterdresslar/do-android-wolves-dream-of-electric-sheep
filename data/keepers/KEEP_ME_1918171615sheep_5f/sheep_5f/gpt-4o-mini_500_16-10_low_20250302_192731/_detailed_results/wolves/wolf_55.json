A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves in the area, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between aggression and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the population of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population."
