            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without exhausting myself or attracting too much competition from other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself, as the wolf population remains stable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased, indicating a potential for competition among wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I have enough strength to survive in case of future challenges.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, a higher hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased, indicating a potential for competition among wolves.
