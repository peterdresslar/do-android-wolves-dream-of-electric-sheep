            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food while conserving energy for future hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more sustainable, allowing me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
