            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as I don't want to overexert myself in a situation where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or failure if the hunt does not succeed."
