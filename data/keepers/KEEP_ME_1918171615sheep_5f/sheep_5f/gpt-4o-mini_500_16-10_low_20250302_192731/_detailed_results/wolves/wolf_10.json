            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent increase in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive without overexerting myself, especially since the sheep population is not extremely high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves is increasing, which means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can still secure enough food while conserving energy and reducing the risk of confrontation with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be fiercer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better ensure that I secure enough food while still being mindful of the sheep population. This balance helps me survive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without exhausting my resources."
