With fewer sheep available and a decrease in the wolf population, a more moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",

A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to vulnerability.",

With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still a concern. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the plentiful prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
