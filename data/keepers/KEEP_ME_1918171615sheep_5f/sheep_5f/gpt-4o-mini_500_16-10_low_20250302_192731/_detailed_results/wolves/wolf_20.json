            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can conserve energy for future hunts while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
