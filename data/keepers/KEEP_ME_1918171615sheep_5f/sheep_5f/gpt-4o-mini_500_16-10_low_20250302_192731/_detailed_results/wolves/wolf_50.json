            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased, so has the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with 59.78 sheep and 6 wolves, the competition is high. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows for sustainable hunting without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to maintain my strength for future hunts, especially as the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival amidst rising competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population."
