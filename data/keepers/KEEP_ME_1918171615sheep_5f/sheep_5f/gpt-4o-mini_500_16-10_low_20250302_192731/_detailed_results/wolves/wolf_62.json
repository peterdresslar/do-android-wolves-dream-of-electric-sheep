A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, indicating increased competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overhunting, ensuring I have enough resources while not competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy may help me survive longer in a challenging environment."
