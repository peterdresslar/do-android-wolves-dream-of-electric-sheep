By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts.
