            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while reducing the risk of competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself or drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food for myself while still being mindful of the sheep population, which is not overly abundant. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still having a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself."
