            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk my survival. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I have enough resources without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for fewer sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food may be less intense, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still ensuring I can secure enough food without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still being cautious, as the wolf population has not changed. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population is declining.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population at 29.77 and the wolf population stable at 10.00, there is still a reasonable chance of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, especially since the other wolves are also competing for the same prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there is a good chance of finding food without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This balance allows me to ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy expenditure and the likelihood of a successful hunt. This also helps me stay competitive with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my hunting intensity to take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself, considering the stable number of wolves and the need to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me.
