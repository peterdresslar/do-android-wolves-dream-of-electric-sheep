            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and scarcity. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overhunting, ensuring I can survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the dwindling wolf numbers. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for a successful hunt. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A moderate intensity will help ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
