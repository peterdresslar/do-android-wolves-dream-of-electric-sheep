            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less viable. By increasing my intensity from 0.28 to 0.45, I can better balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves, who are also increasing in number.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has also decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and ensures I don't exhaust myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition."
