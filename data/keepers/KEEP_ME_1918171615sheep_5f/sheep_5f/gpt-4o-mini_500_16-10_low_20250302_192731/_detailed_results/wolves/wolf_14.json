By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, competition for food will be tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, balancing the need for survival with the current scarcity of resources."
