            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, given that other wolves are still hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the overall situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting may become more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.30 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is lower, so I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy and avoid overexertion."
