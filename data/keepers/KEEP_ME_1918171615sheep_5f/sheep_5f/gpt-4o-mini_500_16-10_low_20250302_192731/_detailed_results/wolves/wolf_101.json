            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta slightly from 0.32 to 0.45, I can take advantage of the available resources without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy may help me avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity may help me conserve energy while still allowing for a successful hunt. This approach also reduces competition with other wolves, as they will likely be hunting at maximum intensity. By being strategic, I can increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more cautious approach is needed. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
