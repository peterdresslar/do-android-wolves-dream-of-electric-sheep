            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves, competition for food is significant. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of energy or resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the sheep population. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can ensure a sustainable food source while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and scarcity. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival."
