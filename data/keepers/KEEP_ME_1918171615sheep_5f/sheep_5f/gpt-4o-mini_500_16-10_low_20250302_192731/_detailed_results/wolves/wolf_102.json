            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can secure food without overexerting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increasing number of sheep, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the competition among wolves is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population and the decrease in sheep, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the declining prey and wolf population."
