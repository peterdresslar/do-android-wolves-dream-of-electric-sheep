By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack's survival while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to failure if the hunt does not succeed.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
