            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion and potential danger from other wolves. This approach allows me to be strategic and ensure my survival in a changing environment."
