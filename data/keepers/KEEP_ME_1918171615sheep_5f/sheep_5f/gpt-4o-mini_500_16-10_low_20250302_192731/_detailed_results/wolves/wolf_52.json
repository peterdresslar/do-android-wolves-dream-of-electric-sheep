This balance helps ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves, who may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
