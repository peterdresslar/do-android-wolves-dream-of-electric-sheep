            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food, but the number of wolves remains the same. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the abundant prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. With more wolves around, a lower intensity may also reduce competition for the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given the recent decline in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the changing dynamics of the pack."
