            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. With the decrease in the wolf population, competition for prey is likely to be fierce, and a higher theta will improve my chances of successfully hunting while still being mindful of not overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained the same. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 40.03 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the number of wolves hasn't changed. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to adapt to the competition while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's important to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. By hunting at a slightly lower intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's success while ensuring my own survival in case of future food shortages."
