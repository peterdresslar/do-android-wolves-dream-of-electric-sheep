            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better compete for the limited food resources while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a stable wolf population."
