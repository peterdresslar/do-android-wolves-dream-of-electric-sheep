            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means there is less food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population at 25.30 and the wolf population stable at 21.00, there is still a reasonable amount of prey available. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself, ensuring I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs."
