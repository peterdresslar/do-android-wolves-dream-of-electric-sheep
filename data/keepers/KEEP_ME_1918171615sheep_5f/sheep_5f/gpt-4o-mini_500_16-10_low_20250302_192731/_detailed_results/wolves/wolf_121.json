            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for a successful hunt without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This balance allows me to survive while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains a factor.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows for a more sustainable approach, ensuring I can survive longer while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 25 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself when resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to avoid overexerting myself, as the recent decrease in the wolf population indicates that resources may be scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
