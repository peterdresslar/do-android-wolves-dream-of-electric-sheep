            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a greater opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.55 allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, allowing me to hunt more strategically and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a more moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta slightly, I can take advantage of the current abundance of prey while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where resources are limited. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious."
