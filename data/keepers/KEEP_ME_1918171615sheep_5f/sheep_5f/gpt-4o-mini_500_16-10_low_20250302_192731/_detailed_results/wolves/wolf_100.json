            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can secure enough food for survival. A moderate increase in theta allows me to take advantage of the sheep without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 45.04 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival while avoiding overexertion that could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in both sheep and wolves, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially since other wolves are also struggling."
