            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt aggressively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is lower, allowing me to hunt with moderate intensity without risking overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available sheep while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to further decline in my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to vulnerability. A theta of 0.75 allows me to take advantage of the situation without risking too much energy."
