With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or risking injury in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in this challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
