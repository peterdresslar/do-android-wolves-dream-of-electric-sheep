            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may lead to a more sustainable survival strategy in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk my survival. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
