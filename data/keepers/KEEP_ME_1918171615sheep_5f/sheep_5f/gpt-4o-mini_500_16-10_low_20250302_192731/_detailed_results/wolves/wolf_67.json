            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
