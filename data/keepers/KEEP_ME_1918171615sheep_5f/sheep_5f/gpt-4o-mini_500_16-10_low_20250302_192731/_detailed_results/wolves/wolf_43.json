            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as the trend shows a decrease in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while reducing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of the competition and my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment."
