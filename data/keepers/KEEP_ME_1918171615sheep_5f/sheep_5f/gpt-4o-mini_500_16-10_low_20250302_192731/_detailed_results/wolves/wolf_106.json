            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexertion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
