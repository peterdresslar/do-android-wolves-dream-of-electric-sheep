            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts and avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to competition with other wolves. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure enough food without overexerting myself in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less sustainable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment while waiting for conditions to improve."
