By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",

By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a crowded hunting scenario. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring I can hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which could be detrimental if food becomes scarce."
