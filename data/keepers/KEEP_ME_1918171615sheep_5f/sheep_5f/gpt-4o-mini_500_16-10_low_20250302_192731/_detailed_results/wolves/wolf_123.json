            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious about overexerting myself, especially since other wolves may also be competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
