            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion and risking injury. This way, I can still contribute to my survival without drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
