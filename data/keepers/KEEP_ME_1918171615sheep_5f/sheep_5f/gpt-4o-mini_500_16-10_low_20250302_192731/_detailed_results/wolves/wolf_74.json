By raising my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself.
