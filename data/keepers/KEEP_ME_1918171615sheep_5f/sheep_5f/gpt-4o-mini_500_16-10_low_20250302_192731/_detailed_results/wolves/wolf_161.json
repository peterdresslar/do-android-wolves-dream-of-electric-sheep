            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there is a good opportunity for hunting. However, I want to balance my energy expenditure and avoid overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving some energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 32.58 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition is high. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch enough prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep at 33.65 and wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, hunting at a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This strategy helps ensure my survival by balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can capitalize on the abundance of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when needed. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.
