            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion and risking injury or exhaustion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing me to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still being effective in securing food. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
