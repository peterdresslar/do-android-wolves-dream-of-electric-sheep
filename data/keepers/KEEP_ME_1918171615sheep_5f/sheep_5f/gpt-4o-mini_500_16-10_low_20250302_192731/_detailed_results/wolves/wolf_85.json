            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food to sustain us. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current abundance without overexerting myself, ensuring I remain healthy and capable of hunting in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the larger prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.60 to 0.75, I can optimize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep numbers. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.
