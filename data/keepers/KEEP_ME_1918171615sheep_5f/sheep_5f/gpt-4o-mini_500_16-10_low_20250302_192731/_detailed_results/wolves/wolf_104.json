            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival, while still being cautious not to overexert myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, ensuring my survival in this competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, there's a better chance of successfully hunting without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt."
