            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial as the wolf population is rising, and competition for food will be fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
