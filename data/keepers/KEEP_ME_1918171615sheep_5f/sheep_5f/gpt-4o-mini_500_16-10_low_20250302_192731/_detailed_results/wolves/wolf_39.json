            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the dwindling prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
