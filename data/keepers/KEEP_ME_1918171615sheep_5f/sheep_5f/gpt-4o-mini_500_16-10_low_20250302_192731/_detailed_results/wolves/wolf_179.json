            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.50, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can secure food without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous level, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still conserving energy in case the situation changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 21 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing directly at maximum intensity with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a good food source, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still having a chance to catch prey when needed."
