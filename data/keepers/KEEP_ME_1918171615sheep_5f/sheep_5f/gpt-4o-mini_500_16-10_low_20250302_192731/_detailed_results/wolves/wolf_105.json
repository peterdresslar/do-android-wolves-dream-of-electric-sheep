            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the rising wolf population and ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity increases my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between maximizing my hunting efforts and conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and risk of injury in a dwindling population."
