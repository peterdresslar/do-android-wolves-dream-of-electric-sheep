            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
