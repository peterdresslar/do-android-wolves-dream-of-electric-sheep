            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of failure in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the overall wolf population is also declining.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy, as the overall population of prey is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
