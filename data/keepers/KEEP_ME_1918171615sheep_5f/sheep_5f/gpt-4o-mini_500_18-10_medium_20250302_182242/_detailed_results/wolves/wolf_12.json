            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations. This value balances the need to hunt for reproduction while also allowing the sheep to recover, preventing overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (12.6% of maximum capacity), which suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support my pack"
