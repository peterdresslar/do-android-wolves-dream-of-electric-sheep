            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 127.72, which is only 12.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while also considering the gradual increase in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta reflects the need for balance as both populations are interdependent."
