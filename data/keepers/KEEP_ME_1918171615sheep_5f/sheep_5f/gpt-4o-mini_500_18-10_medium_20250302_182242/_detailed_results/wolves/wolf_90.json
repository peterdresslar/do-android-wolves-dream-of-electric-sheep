            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting presence to support our own population. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment that respects the delicate balance of the ecosystem."
