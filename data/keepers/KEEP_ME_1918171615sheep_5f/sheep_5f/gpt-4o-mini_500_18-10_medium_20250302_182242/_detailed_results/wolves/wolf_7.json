This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.65, which is only 3.5% of its maximum capacity.

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the potential for future growth in both populations.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
