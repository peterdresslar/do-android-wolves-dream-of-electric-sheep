            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 34\n- Sheep population: 88.30\n- Wolf population: 70.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.059\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.26 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 8.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 88.30, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a cautious approach to hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can begin to focus on sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting. This gradual adjustment will help prevent further depletion of the sheep population and allow for recovery, while also considering the current high wolf population."
