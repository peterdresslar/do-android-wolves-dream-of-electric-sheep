            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.09, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.713 indicates a strong focus on hunting, I need to balance this with the need for sheep recovery. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition within the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
