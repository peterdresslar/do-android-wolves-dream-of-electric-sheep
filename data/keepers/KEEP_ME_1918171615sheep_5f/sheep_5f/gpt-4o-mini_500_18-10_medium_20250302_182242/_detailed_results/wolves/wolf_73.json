            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while allowing our own numbers to stabilize.
