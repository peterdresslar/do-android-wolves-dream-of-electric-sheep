This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
