            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will also support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.9% of maximum capacity), which suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow for recovery. By slightly decreasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover."
