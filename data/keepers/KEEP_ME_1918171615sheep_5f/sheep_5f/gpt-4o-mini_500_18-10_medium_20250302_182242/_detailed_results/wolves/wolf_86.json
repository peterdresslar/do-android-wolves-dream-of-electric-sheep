            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 62.70, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem and preventing over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.67, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
