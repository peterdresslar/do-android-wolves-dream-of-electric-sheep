            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This gradual adjustment allows for a better balance between hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards reducing hunting intensity. This will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem."
