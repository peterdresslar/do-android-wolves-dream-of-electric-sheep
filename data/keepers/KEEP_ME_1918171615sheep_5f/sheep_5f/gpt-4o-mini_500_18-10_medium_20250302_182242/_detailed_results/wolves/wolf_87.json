            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to grow, which is essential for long-term sustainability."
