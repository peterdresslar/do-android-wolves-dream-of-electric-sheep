            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 65\n- Sheep population: 7.01\n- Wolf population: 2.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.400\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 3.50 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 0.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing the wolf population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This balanced approach is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to population changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.33, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was focused on competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still being cautious not to over-deplete them. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.56, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.96, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.41, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can help ensure that the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to gradually recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.88, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.42, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 2.00, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the wolves can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.01, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is 3.50, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and support the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some competition among wolves."
