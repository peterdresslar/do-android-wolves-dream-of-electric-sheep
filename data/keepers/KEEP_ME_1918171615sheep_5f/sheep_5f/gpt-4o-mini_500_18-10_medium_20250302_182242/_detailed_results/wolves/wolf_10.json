            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 19.41. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between our populations, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population"
