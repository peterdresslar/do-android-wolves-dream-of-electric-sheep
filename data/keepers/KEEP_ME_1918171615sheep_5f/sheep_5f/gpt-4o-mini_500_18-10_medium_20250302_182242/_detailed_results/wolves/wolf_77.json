            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm our own survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a minimal focus on hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity would further deplete the sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and the long-term health of our wolf pack. A gradual increase in theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover."
