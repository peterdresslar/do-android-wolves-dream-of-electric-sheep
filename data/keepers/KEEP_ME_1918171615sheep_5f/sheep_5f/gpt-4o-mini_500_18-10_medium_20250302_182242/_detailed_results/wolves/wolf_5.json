            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.00, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep to increase in number. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.93, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.93, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.11, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.50, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus more on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.04, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.73, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.68, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for food with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.74, which is only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. By slightly increasing from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can maintain a cautious approach that supports both the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.12, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is high. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a dramatic decline in the sheep population."
