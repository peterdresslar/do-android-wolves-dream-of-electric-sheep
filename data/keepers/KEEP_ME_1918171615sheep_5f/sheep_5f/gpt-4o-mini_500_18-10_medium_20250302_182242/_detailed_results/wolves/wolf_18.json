            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 138.90, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.951 indicates a strong focus on hunting, I recognize the need to gradually reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.85 strikes a balance between maintaining my hunting needs and ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.27, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.700 was effective for hunting, it is important to reduce hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to increase, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
