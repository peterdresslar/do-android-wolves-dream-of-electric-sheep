            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.6% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.149. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase to 0.25 will help balance the needs of both populations without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a cautious approach. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (13.4% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promoting coexistence."
