            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.41, which is just 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem while still acknowledging the competitive pressures from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too focused on competition with other wolves. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the survival of my pack while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery.
