            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.1% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This approach supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it encourages sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.644 allows for adaptation to the current conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (16.2% of maximum capacity), which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring that both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population."
