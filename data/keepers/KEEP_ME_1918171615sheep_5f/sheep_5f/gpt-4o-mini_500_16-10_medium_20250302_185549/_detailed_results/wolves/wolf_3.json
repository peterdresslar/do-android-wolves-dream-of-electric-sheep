            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 2\n- Sheep population: 17.69\n- Wolf population: 9.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.500\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.97 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.8% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.69, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also prepares for potential increases in sheep numbers in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting aspect. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting, but not enough to deplete the sheep further. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species."
