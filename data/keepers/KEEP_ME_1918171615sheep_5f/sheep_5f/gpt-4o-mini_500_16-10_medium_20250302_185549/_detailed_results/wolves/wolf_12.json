            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.5% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with only 6 wolves, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate adjustment will help maintain balance while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a healthy sheep population. Gradually increasing theta allows for a balance that avoids depleting the sheep too quickly."
