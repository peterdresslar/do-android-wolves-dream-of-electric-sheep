            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.87, which is only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This requires a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.222 to 0.25, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.70, which is only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
