            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.41, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Additionally, with a high wolf population of 70, focusing on competition among wolves rather than hunting will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further."
