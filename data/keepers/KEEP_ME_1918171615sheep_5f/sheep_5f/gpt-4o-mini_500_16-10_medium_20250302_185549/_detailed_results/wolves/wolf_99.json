            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.70, which is just 0.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overexploitation of the sheep."
