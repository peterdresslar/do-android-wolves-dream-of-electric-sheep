A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.80, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.48, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity.
