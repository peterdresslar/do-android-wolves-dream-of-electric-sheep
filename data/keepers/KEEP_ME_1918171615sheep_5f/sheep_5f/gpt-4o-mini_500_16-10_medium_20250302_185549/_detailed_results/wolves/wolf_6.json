            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.69 and represents only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.48, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.06, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.82, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the potential for future growth in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.77, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting compared to my previous value, allowing for some reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.92, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, as it avoids overexploitation of the sheep while still recognizing the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.88, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.71, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf health. This moderate adjustment will help the sheep recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.78, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population."
