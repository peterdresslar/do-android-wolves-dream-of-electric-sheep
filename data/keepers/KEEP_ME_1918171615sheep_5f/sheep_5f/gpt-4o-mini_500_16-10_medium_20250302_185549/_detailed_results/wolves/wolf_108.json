            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem and prevent a potential crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species, and sudden increases in hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
