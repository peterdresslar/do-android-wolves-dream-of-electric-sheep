By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still being mindful of the need to avoid over-depletion. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable approach as the ecosystem recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 2.89, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still hunt while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance competition among wolves and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
