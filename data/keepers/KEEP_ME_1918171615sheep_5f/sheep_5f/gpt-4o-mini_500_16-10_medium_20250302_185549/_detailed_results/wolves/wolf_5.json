            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.69, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.80, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.48, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.06, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.82, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow without excessive hunting pressure. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.77, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is high at 5.35. This indicates that while there is some room for hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery."
