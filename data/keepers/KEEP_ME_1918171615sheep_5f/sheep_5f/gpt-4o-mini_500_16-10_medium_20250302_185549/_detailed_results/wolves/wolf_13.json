            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 19.15. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to allow for recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta will help focus on competition with other wolves, ensuring our population remains stable while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (16.2% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
