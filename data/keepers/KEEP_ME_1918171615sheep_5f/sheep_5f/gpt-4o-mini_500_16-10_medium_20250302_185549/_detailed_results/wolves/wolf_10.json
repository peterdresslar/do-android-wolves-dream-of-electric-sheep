            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (11.6% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking a severe depletion of their numbers. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while also considering the current trends in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
