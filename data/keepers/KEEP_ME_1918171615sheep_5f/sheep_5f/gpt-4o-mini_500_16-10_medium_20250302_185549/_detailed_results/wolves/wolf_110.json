            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents overexploitation, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. Additionally, with a relatively high wolf population, focusing on competition rather than hunting will help stabilize our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
