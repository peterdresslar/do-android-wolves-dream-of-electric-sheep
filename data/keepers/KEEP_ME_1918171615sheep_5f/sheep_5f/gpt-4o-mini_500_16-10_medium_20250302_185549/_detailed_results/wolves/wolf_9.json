By setting a moderate theta of 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.81, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the sheep population",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.05, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.82, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.77, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A lower theta value allows me to focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help maintain our population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. Gradual adjustments are key to ensuring a sustainable balance.",
