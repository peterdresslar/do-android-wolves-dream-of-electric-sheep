            "I chose this theta because while the number of sheep is still relatively high, the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the increased wolf population means I may face more competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting intensity may need to be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexploiting the sheep resource.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
