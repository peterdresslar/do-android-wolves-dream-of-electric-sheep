            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.64 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be adjusted to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.40, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 20 wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is increasing, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
