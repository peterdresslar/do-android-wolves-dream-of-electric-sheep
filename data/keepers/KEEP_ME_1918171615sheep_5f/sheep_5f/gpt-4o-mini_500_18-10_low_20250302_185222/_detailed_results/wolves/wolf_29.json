            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival given the stable wolf population. A moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, and the number of wolves has decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to take advantage of the situation. This will help ensure I get enough food without overexerting myself, considering the recent decrease in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13 wolves, the competition for food is still manageable. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is increasing, which means there is more food available. However, the wolf population has decreased, indicating competition for resources is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with moderate intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself. This balance helps me survive while being mindful of the changing dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and potential failure in catching prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A moderate increase in theta allows me to take advantage of the larger sheep population without risking competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves decreasing, there is a greater opportunity for successful hunts. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 9 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding competition with other wolves. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising.
