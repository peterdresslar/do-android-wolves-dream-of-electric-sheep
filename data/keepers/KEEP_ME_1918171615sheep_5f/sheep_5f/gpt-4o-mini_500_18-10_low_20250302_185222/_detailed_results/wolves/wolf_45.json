            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population remains stable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while being cautious of the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, allowing me to hunt with less intensity while still securing enough food for survival. A lower theta also helps conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant."
