            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there",
            "I chose this theta because with 53.66 sheep and 8 wolves, the competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy conservation and ensuring I get enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolf population, competition for food is likely to be fierce. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the situation while still being cautious, as the wolf population is increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a declining environment."
