            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's success while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This way, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while still taking advantage of the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food for myself while still being mindful of the sheep population, which has decreased slightly. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
