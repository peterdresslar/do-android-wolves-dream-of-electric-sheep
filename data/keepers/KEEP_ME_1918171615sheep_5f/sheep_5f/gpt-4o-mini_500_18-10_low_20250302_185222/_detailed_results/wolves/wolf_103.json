            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting might be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity from 0.25 to 0.40, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I still have energy for future hunts while being competitive against other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less certain. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and still have a chance to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with the wolf population remaining stable, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for more food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundance of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious."
