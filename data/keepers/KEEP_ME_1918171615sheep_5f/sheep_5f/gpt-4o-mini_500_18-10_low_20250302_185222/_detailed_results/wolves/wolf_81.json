            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food without overexerting myself or risking injury. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt if necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to survival given the recent decline in both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 19 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy balances my need for survival with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, which is crucial given their recent decrease in numbers. This strategy increases my chances of survival while still allowing for successful hunts.",
