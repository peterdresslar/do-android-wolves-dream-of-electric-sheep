            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is becoming fiercer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food while also conserving energy. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",

With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and increased risk of injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of energy or resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy reduces the risk of competition with other wolves and ensures my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 36.84 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid competition with other wolves and ensure my survival by not overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because while the number of wolves is increasing, the sheep population is also relatively high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer without overexerting myself. This strategy balances the need to hunt with the risk of depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting given the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a lower availability of prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the overall ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
