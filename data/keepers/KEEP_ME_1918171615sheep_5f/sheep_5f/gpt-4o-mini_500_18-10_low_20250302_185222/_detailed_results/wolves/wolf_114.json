            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more sustainable, allowing me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A moderate approach increases my chances of survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall trend shows a decline in wolves, which could mean a need for more food to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.75, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competing with other wolves, who may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of the plentiful food source while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows for sustainable hunting while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, which is crucial given their recent decline. This strategy increases my chances of survival while still allowing for successful hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food supply. With 11 wolves competing for resources, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious, as other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is intensifying. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment where resources are becoming scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.
