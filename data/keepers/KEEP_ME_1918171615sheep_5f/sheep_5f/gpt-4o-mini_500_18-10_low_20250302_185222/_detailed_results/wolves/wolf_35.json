            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the trend shows a decrease in both sheep and wolves, indicating a potential scarcity in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population at 31.97 and the number of wolves stable at 10, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy reduces competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with 33.39 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey while being mindful of my resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and maintain my strength for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This approach balances the need to hunt with the risk of overexertion, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting given the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself.
