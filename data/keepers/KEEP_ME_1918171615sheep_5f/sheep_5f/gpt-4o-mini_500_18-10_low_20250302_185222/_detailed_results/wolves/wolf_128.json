            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey before other wolves do. However, I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success in hunting. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a dwindling population."
