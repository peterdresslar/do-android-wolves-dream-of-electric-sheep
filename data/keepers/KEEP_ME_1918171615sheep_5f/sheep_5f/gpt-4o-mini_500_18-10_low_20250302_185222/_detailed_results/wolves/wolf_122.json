            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves."
