A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less predictable. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
