            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I push too hard. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at a lower intensity may help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. By being strategic, I can still secure food without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has also decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion and risking my survival. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient without drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, which presents a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because with 31.97 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.
