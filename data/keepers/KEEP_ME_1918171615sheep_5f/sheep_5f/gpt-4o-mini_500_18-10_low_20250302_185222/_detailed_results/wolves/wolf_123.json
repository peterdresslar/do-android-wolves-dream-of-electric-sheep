            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population and a decrease in sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the competition with other wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased recently. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the recent decrease in wolves suggests competition for food is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention from other wolves, while still contributing to the pack"
