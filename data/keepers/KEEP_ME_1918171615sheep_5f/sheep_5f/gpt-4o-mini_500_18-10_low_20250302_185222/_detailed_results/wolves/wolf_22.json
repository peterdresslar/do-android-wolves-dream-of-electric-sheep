            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as the increase in wolf population means competition is higher. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's crucial to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs."
