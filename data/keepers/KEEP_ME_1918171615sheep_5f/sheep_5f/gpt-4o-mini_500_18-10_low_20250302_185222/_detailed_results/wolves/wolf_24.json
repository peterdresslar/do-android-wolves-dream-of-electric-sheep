However, the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with slightly more intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.65 balances the need for food with the caution required in a declining wolf population."
