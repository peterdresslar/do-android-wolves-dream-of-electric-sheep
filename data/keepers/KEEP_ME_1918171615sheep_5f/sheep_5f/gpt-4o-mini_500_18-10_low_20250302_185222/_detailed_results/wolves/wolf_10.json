            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overwhelming competition from other wolves. By maintaining a low intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid detection while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the increased sheep numbers while still minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the increasing wolf population without risking my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer and wait for a more favorable situation."
