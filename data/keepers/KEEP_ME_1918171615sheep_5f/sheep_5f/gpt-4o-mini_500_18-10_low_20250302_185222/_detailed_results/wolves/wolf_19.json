            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.25 to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious about the decreasing wolf population."
