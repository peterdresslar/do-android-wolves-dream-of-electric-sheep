            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is likely to intensify. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's success without risking my own survival too much.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and hunting at full intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise."
