            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient without overexerting, especially since the other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and potential injury. This approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in wolves suggests competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack"
