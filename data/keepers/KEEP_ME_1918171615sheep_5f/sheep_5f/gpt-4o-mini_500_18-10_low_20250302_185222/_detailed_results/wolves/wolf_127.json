With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows me to adapt to the changing environment without risking too much energy, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the overall trend shows a decrease in the wolf population."
