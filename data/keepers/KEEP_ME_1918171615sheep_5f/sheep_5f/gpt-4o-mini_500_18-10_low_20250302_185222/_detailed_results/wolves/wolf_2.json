            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively while also being cautious of competition."
