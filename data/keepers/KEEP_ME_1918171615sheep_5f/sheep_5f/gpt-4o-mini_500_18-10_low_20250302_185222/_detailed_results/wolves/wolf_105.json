            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep at 42.30 and wolves remaining stable at 12.00, there is a good opportunity to hunt without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt, especially since I can adapt my strategy based on the behavior of other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with 44.82 sheep and 13 wolves, the competition for food is still present, but I want to balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure enough food for survival. A slightly increased intensity from my previous 0.30 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, considering the stable number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can capitalize on the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By lowering my intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without risking my own well-being.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can capitalize on the abundance of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant."
