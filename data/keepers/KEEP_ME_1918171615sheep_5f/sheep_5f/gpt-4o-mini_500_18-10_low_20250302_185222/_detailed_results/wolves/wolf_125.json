            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to conserve energy while ensuring I can still hunt effectively. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can avoid competition with other wolves who might be hunting at maximum intensity, allowing me to hunt more efficiently and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the number of wolves has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a changing environment."
