            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity increases my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves for food while still managing my energy reserves. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while being cautious about the competition from other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself in a potentially risky environment."
