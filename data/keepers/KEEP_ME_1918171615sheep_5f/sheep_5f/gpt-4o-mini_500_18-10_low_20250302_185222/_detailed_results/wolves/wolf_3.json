            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food, but the number of wolves remains the same. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 21.85, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while also conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment."
