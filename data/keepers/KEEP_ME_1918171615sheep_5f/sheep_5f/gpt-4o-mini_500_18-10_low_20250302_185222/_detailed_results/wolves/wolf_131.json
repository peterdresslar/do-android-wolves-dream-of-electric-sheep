            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can ensure I contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. It also helps me avoid drawing too much attention from other wolves, who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion with the need to secure food. This way, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive. A moderate approach will help me adapt to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources and avoid overexertion, which could lead to vulnerability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective."
