            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's success without risking my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food for myself while still being cautious not to overexert and risk injury or exhaustion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is increasing. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with 25 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased, indicating increased competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increase my chances of survival."
