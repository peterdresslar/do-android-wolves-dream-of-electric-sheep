            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's important to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, since the number of wolves has remained the same, I need to be cautious about overexerting myself. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still conserving energy in case the situation changes. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A lower intensity also reduces the risk of overexertion and potential injury, ensuring my long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
