            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, ensuring my survival in this fluctuating environment."
