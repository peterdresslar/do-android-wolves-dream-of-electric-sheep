            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking too much competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully catching sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population and a decrease in sheep, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing food. However, I want to balance my energy expenditure and avoid overexertion, so I will not go to maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is rising. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still ensuring I can hunt effectively when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing slightly and the wolf population remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased.
