With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt."
