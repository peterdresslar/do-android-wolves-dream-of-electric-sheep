            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This adjustment allows me to adapt to the changing environment and the increasing number of wolves, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
