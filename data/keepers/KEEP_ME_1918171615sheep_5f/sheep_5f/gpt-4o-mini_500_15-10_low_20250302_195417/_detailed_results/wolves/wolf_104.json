            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival in a more cautious manner.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity. A moderate increase allows me to balance the risk of competition with the need to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting opportunities are becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
