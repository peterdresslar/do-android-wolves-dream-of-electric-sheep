            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is stable, and with 10 wolves competing for the same prey, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. This balance allows me to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential overhunting. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the hunt while ensuring that I conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention from other wolves."
