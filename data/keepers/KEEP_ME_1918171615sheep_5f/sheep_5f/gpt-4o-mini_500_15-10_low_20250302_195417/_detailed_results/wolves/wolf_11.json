            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is still relatively high, the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is still relatively high, the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. This suggests that competition for food is rising, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with 40 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
