By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a more crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to catch enough food. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself.",
