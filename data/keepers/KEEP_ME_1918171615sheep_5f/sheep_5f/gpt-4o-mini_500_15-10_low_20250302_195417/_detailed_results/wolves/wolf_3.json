However, since the number of wolves remains the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I can still compete effectively with others. A theta of 0.70 allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still being cautious, as the other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
