            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensures my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival given the current competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure I can hunt effectively without risking my own well-being.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 31.95 sheep and 12 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is important for long-term survival. This balance allows me to be more efficient in my hunting while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity without risking overexertion. This will help ensure I can secure enough food while still being mindful of the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with 34.14 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources while still conserving energy. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This balance will help ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with 37.46 sheep and 11 wolves, the prey-to-predator ratio is favorable. Increasing my hunting intensity will improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for survival with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and wolves remaining the same, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially dwindling food supply. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.
