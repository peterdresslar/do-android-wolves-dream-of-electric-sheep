By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",

By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
