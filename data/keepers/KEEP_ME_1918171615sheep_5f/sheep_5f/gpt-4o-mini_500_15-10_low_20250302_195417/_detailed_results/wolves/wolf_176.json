            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can still contribute to the hunt while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This way, I can ensure my survival while still being part of the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves."
