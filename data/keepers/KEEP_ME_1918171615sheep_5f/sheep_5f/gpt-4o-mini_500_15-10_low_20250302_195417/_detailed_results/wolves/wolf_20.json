            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, and with the recent increase in wolves, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
