            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the increased prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance helps ensure that I can contribute to the pack's success while also conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the other wolves are also hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, a more aggressive hunting strategy is necessary to secure enough food for survival. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury, so I will increase my intensity but not go to the maximum.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions are more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations suggests that resources are becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a declining environment. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack"
