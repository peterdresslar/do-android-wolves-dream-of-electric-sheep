By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more effective than my previous choice while still being cautious."
