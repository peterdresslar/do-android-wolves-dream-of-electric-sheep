            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance will help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when chances arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, which are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer during tough times while still being able to hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves for the dwindling prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
