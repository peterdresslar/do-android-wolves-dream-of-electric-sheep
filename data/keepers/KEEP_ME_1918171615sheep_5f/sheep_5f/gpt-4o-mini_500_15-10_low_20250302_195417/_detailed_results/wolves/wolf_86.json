By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
