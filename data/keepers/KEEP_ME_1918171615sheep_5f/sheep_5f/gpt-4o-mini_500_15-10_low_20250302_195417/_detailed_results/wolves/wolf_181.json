            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.70, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competition from other wolves, who are likely hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population stable, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in wolves suggests that competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This strategy may help me survive longer in a challenging environment."
