            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because while the number of sheep is still relatively high, the increase in wolves suggests that competition for food is rising. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch some sheep. This strategy allows me to survive in a more competitive environment without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can still secure enough food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable, and competition for prey is still present.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition remains high with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
