            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has recently increased, which means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing me to balance my needs with the increased competition. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between ensuring I get enough food while not overexerting myself in a competitive situation with other wolves. This way, I can adapt to the current scarcity and still have a chance to survive."
