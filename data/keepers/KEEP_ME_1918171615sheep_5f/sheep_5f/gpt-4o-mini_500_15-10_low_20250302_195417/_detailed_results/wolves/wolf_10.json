            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, making competition for food more intense. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment."
