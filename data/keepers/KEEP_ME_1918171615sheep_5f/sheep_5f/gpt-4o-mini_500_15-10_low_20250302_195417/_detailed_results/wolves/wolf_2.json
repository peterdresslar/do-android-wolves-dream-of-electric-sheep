            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 15 sheep, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has also decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment where resources are limited."
