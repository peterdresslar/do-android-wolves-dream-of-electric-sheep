            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting unnecessary attention from other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high, so I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
