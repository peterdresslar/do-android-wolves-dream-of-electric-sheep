            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling prey and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food while being cautious about the dwindling wolf numbers."
