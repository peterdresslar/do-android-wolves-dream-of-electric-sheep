            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is important given the stable number of wolves. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion and risking injury. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining trend of wolves and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with others.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This strategy balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, as the competition among wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the same prey, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This strategy balances my need for food with the risk of competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment.
