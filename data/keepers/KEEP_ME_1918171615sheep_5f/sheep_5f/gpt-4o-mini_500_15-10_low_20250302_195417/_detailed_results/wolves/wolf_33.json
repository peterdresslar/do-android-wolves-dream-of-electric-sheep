            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in wolves, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at full intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for food while considering the current dynamics of the pack."
