            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can sustain myself without depleting the resources too quickly. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while also being cautious, given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when needed. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while also conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves.
