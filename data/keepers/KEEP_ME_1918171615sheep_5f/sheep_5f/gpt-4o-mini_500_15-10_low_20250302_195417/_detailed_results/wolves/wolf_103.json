            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious. This allows me to secure food without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is still present.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the number of wolves decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking failure. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. The sheep population is relatively high, so I can afford to be less aggressive and still have a chance to catch prey without exhausting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at a lower intensity will help ensure that I can still find food without competing too aggressively with others. This balance allows for sustainable hunting while minimizing risk.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. By raising my theta to 0.65, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious, as the recent increase in wolves suggests competition for food is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the increasing wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
