By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can contribute to the pack's survival while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial given the current dynamics.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure I can hunt effectively without risking my own survival in a dwindling environment."
