This balance helps ensure that I can still secure food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves, who are also increasing in number.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means competition for food is increasing among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and scarcity. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack's success."
