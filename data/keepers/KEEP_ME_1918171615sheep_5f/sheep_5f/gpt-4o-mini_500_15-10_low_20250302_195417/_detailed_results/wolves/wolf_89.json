            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making them scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves has increased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population has also decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a cautious approach is necessary. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is relatively stable. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity. This will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack's needs."
