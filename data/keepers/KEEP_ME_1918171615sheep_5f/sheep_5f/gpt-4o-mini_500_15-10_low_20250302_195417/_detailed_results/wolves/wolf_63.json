With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious about the dwindling wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting may become more competitive among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival without risking depletion of resources."
