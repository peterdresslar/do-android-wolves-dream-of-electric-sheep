A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food while also being cautious of competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself."
