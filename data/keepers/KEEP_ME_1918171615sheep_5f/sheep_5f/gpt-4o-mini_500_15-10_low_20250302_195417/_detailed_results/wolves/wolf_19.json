            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain us without overexerting myself. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers."
