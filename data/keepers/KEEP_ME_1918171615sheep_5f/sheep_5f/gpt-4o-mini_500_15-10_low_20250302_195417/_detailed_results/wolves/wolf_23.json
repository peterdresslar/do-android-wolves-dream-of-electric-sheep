With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity of 0.40 allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the dwindling sheep population. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting opportunity."
