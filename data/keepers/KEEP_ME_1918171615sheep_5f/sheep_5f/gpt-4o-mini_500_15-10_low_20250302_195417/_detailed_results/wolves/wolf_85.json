            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the current situation while being mindful of the declining wolf population."
