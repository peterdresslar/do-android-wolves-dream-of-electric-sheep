            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is still relatively high, the increase in wolves suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the sheep without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased, making competition for food more intense. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I aim to secure enough food while still being cautious, as the overall population of wolves is declining. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive situation."
