            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, and I want to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while also contributing to the pack's success. A moderate intensity allows me to balance my needs with the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, while the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited sheep available. This strategy allows me to survive longer and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or competing too fiercely with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition. This way, I can still hunt effectively while ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
