            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also decreasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and risk of injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a declining population."
