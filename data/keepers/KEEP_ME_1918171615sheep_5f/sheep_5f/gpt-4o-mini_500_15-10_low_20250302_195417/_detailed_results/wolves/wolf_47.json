            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and avoiding direct conflict with my pack mates.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better hunting conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can secure enough food. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing dynamics of the environment."
