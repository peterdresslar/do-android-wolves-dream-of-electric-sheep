By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival while adapting to the changing dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the overall trend indicates a decline in wolves.",
