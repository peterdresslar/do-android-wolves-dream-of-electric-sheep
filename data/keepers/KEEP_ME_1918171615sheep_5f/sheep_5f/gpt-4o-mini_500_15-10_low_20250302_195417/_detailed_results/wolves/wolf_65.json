            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial given the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and risk of injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a dwindling population of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, and the number of wolves has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may allow me to conserve energy while still being able to catch enough prey. A theta of 0.45 balances the need to hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
