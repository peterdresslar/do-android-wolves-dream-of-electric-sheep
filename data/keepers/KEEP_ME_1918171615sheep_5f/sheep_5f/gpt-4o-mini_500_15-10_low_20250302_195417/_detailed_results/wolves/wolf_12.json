By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the rising wolf population without risking my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population while still conserving energy to avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival amidst the rising number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the rising number of wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that there are enough resources for both myself and the other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively."
