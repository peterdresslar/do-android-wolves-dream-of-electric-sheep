            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the increased wolf population while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that prey is becoming scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tighter food supply. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less rewarding. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
