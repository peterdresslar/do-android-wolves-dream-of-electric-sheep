            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I want to balance my hunting efforts. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens."
