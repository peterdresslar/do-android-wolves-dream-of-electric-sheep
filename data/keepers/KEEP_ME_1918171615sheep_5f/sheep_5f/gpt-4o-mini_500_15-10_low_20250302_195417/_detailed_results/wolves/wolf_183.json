With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for the limited sheep.",

By increasing my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains constant.",

By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey if the opportunity arises.
