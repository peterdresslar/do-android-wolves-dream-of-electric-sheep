            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough sheep without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which has also increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food for myself while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
