            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is still relatively high, the increase in wolf numbers means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent increase in the wolf population, which means more competition for the remaining sheep."
