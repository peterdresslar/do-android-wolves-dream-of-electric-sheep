            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure I can hunt effectively in the future without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there is a greater opportunity for hunting. However, since the number of wolves has remained the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself or competing too aggressively with others. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy."
