            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with 40 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy balances my need for survival with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may be struggling to find food. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still having a chance to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has decreased recently, indicating a potential scarcity of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary."
