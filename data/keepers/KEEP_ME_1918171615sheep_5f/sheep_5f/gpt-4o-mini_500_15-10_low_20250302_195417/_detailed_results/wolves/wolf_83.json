            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, leading to higher competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves is increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the awareness of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when needed."
