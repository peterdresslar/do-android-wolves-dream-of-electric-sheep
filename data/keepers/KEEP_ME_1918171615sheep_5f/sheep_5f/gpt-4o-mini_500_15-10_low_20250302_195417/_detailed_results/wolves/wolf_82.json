            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased, so has the number of wolves. A slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival given the recent trends."
