With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure.

A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
