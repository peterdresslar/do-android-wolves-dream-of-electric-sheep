            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and scarcity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity will help ensure that I do not overexert myself and can still find food without competing too aggressively with other wolves. This balance allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current sheep population at 35.40 and a stable number of wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while reducing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity will help ensure that I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can ensure that I contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, I can afford to hunt at a slightly lower intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there's a greater opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the situation while still conserving energy compared to the maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, leading to more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting the sheep, ensuring that I have enough resources to survive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and still compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can capitalize on the available prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being proactive in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting intensity may need to be adjusted to ensure sustainability. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",

However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the overall trend shows a decrease in the wolf population, indicating that competition is fierce.",
