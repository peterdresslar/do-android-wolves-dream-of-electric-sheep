By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 23.33 sheep and 8 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival while avoiding overexertion that could lead to unnecessary risks. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's success without exhausting myself."
