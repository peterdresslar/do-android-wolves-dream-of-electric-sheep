            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current prey availability and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with a moderate hunting intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. Given the stable number of wolves and the slight increase in sheep, a theta of 0.50 allows me to adapt to the environment without overcommitting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep decreasing slightly and the wolf population remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by balancing the risk of competition with other wolves and the availability of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts and avoiding competition with other wolves."
