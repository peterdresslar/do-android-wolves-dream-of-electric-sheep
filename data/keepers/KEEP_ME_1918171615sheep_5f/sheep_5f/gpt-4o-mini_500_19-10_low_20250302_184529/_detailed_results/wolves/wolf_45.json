            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.50 to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.
