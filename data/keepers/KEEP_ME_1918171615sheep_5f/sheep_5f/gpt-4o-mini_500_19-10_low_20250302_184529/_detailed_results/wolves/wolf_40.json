        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with 23 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the recent decrease in both sheep and wolf populations suggests a more cautious approach is needed. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to further declines in both populations. This strategy allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey.
