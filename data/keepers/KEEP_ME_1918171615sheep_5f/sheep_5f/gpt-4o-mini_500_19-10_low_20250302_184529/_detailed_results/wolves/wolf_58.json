A theta of 0.70 allows me to be competitive without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without exhausting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting.
