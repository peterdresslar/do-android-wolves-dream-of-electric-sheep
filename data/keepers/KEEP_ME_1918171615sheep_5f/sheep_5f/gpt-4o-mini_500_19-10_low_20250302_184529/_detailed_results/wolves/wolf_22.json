            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as I don't want to overexert myself in a situation where resources are dwindling.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, indicating increased competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the decline in my pack, ensuring my survival without risking too much in a competitive situation."
