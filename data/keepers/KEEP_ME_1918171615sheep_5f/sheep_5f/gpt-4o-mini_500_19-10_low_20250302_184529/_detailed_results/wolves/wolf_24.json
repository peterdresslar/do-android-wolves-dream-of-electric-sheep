            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or depletion of resources. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and risk. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overhunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment."
