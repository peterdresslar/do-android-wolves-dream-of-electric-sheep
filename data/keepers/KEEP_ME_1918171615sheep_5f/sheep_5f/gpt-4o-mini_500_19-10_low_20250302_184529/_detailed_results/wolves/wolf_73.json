            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to avoid overexerting myself, as the wolf population remains stable. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, there is a greater opportunity for food. However, since the number of wolves has remained the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting may become more difficult. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure and avoid competition. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A lower intensity will help me avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment."
