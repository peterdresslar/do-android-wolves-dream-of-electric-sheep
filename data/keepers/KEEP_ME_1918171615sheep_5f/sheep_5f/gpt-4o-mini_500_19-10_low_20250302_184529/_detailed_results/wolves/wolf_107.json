            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while reducing the risk of overexertion and attracting attention from other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without pushing myself to the limit.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still being able to hunt effectively when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be more efficient while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without exhausting myself too much. By raising my intensity slightly from my previous 0.30, I can be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing slightly and the wolf population remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's survival without exhausting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become less rewarding. By lowering my intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion.
