By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still secure food without drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which means there is a bit more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with 38.70 sheep and 17 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains the same.",
