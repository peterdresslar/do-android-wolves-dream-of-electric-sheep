            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not very high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still survive while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment."
