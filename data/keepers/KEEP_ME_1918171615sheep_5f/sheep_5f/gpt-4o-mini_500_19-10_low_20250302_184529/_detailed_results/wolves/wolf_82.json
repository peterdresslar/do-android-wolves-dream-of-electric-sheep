            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to compete effectively for food while still conserving energy. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive without overexerting myself.",

This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious about the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a situation where the wolf population remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a slight increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the competition remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, but the number of wolves remains the same.
