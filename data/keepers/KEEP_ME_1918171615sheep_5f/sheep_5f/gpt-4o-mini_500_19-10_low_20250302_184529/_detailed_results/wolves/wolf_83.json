With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly, I can be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

This balance helps ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion and risking injury or exhaustion, especially given the recent decline in both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for dwindling resources. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to be effective while also conserving energy.",
