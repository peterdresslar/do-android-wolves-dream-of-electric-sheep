            "I chose this theta because with 19 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to survive longer without overexerting myself in a situation where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while not overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive than before while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious.

However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself.
