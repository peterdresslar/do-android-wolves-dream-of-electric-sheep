            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 21.89 sheep and 12 wolves, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance the risk of overexerting myself with the need to secure food. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts."
