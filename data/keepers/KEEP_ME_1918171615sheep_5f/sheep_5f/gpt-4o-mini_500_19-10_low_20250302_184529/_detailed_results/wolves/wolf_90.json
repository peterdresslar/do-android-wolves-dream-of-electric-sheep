With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competing with other wolves, who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This way, I can conserve energy while still being effective in my hunting efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival as resources become scarcer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",

By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can still compete effectively with other wolves while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment."
