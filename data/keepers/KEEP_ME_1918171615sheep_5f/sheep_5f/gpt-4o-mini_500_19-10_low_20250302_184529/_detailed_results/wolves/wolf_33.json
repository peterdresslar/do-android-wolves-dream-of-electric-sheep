This allows me to remain agile and adaptable, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",

This balance helps me survive while competing with other wolves.",

A more cautious approach will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
