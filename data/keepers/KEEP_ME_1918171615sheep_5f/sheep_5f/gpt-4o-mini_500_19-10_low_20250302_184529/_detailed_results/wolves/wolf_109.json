            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep population. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.25 to 0.40, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and minimizing competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains constant. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current sheep population at 38.41 and a stable number of wolves, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be efficient while still being cautious, as the competition remains steady."
