This strategy allows me to survive longer without risking injury or depletion of resources.",

However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I can still compete effectively with my pack. A moderate intensity allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving some energy for future hunts, considering the stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, there is a greater chance of successfully hunting without overexerting myself. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy for future hunts while still contributing to the pack's needs.",

By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, I can afford to hunt with slightly less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, as the sheep population is sufficient for a moderate effort.",
