            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This approach balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy helps ensure my survival while still allowing for successful hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, as the number of wolves remains the same. This strategy may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can contribute to the pack's success while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decline in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being cautious, as the sheep population is relatively stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can ensure that I contribute to the pack's success while also conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps me survive in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with a decrease in the wolf population and an increase in sheep, I need to balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a balanced way.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains unchanged. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance may help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current population of wolves remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means there is less food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I don't want to overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion, especially since the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
