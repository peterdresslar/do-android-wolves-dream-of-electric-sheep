            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance the risk of competing with other wolves while ensuring I get enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively without exhausting my energy or drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and overexertion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still conserving some energy for future hunts, considering the stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a stable food source. With the number of wolves remaining constant, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with 17 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 17 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and a decent population of sheep, increasing my hunting intensity slightly can help me secure more food without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to remain competitive while also considering the sustainability of the prey population.",
