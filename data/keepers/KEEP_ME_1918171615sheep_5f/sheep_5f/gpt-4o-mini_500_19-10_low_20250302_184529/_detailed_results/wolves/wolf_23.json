            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the overall trend shows a decrease in the wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious."
