            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population remains stable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited food while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still having a chance to catch prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 16 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves, competition for food is present. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion and potential failure. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the wolf population hasn't changed. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By hunting at a slightly lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 43.08 sheep and 15 wolves, the competition for food is still significant.

            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overhunting, ensuring I have enough resources for survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
