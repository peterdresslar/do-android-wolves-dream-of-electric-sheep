            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 29\n- Sheep population: 137.44\n- Wolf population: 7.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.215\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 19.63 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 13.7% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 137.44, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta to 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (15.1% of maximum capacity), and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations."
