            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is relatively low, and I want to ensure we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population of 9, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current conditions."
