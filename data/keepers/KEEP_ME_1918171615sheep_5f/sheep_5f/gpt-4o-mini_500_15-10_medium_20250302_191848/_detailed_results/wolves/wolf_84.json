            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.07, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance."
