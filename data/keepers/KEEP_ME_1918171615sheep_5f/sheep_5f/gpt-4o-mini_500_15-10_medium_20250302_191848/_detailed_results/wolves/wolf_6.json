            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 12\n- Sheep population: 34.47\n- Wolf population: 4.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.350\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 8.62 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.4% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while we need to ensure our survival through hunting, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.08, there is still a need for some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.68, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.84, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.19, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.32, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a gradual balance that supports both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.17, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt more effectively without risking the depletion of the sheep population. It also considers the need to maintain a healthy wolf population as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.14, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 4.00, maintaining a moderate approach will help ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.38, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.82, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow, which is essential for our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.47, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments."
