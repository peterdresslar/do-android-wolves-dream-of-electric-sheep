            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.1 to 0.2, I can begin to focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover and prevents overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance for both populations. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 2.90, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a significant opportunity for sheep recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.15, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 maintains a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.44, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.74, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.09, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.46, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
