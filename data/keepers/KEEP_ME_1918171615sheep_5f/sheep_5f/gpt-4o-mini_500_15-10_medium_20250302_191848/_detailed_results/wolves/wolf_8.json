This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that prioritizes the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.68, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.32, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
