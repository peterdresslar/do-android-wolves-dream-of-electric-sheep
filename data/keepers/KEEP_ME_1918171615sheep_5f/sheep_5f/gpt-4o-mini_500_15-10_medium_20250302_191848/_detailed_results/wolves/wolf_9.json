This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and ensures a sustainable balance.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.32, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growth of our own population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.17, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.47, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting, but not enough to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.28, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate level of hunting to ensure our own survival.
