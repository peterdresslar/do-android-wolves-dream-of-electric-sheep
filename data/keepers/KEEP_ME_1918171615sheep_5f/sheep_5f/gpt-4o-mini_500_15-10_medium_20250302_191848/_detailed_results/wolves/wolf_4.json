            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.00, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a healthy balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.77, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.62, which is only 1.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover and ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.84, which is only 1.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a significant opportunity for the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.19, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
