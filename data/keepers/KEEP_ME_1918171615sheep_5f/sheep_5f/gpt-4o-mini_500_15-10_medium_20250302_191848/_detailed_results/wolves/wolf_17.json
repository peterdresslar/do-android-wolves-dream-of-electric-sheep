            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 31\n- Sheep population: 154.70\n- Wolf population: 13.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.813\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 11.90 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 15.5% of maximum capacity\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes\n4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes\n5. Consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences of your decisions\nPlease provide a short explanation of your reasoning for choosing theta.\nPlease also provide a short vocalization expressing your wolf's attitude about the current situation.\nPlease respond with a JSON object in this format, where [your new theta] is a float between 0 and 1 with your new theta (up to 2 decimal places):\n\n            {\n                \"theta\": [your new theta],\n                \"explanation\": \"I chose this theta because...\",\n                \"vocalization\": \"Growwllllllll...\"\n            }\n            "

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase in hunting will help sustain our pack while allowing the sheep to recover."
