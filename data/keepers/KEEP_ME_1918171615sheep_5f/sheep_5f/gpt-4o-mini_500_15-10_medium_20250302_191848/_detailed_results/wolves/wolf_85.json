            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring future hunting opportunities and the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also considering the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach that prioritizes sustainability while still acknowledging the need for some hunting."
