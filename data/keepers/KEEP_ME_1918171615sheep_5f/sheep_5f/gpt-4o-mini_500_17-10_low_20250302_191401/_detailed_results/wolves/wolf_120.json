            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.55 to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased recently, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is also decreasing. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must also be cautious, as the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while still being mindful of the risks involved.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources.
