            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to take advantage of the surplus while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with 28.71 sheep and 8 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This approach allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for that food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about overexerting myself and risking injury or depletion of resources."
