With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance may help me secure food without overexerting myself, especially since the overall wolf population is declining.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the dwindling wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be aggressive enough to secure food without overexerting myself."
