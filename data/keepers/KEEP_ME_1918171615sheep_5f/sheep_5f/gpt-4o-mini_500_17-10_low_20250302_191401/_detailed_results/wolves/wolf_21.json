            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the pack, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while not overexerting myself, considering the recent decrease in the wolf population. A theta of 0.50 allows me to contribute to the hunt without risking too much energy or attracting unnecessary attention from other wolves."
