            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts. This balance helps me survive while still being cautious of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival as I navigate the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, balancing the risk of overexertion with the need to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With more wolves competing for the same limited prey, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid unnecessary competition. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves remains uncertain. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
