            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don't overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food, but the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still benefiting from the available prey. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the plentiful sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for resources is high. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with 26.16 sheep and only 11 wolves, the competition is not too fierce. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the larger prey population while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment."
