            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding competition. A slightly higher intensity than before will help me secure my share without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This strategy minimizes competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without drawing too much attention."
