            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",

By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
