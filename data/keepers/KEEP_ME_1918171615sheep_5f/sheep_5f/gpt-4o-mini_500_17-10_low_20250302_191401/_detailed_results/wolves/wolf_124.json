            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can avoid direct competition with other wolves and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to remain stealthy and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be more opportunities for hunting without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a changing environment."
