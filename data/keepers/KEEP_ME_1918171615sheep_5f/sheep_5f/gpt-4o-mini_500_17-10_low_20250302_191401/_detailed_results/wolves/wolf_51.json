            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is still relatively high, the increase in wolves suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to survive in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the wolf population has increased and competition for food is higher.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success."
