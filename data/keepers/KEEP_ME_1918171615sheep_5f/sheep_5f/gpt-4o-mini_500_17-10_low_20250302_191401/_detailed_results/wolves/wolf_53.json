            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting, which helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves, the competition for food is still manageable. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent increase in wolves, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy balances the risk of overhunting and ensures my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting is becoming more challenging. However, with the recent increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy, as I anticipate competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population is also down. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run."
