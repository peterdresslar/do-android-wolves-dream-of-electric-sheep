            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population and a slight decrease in sheep, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion and potential competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is intensifying. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep population. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 22 wolves, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity while still ensuring I get enough food. This will help me conserve energy and avoid overexertion, especially since the trend shows a decrease in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more efficient in my hunting while still conserving energy for future needs."
