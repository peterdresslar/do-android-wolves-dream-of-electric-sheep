            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain efficient while adapting to the changing dynamics of the pack and prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food. Increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive without exhausting myself, especially since the overall wolf population has decreased, which may mean less competition for the remaining sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient without overexerting myself.",
