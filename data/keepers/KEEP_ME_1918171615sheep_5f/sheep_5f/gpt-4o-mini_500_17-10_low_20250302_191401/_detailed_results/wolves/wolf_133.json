            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.16 to 0.25, I can still contribute to my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means food might become scarce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, ensuring my survival while still being cautious about the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more effective without risking too much competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, I can afford to be slightly less aggressive while still ensuring I get enough food to survive. This balance helps me avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at a slightly higher intensity than my previous theta of 0.60 will help me compete effectively for resources while still being cautious not to overexert myself."
