By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially dangerous environment."
