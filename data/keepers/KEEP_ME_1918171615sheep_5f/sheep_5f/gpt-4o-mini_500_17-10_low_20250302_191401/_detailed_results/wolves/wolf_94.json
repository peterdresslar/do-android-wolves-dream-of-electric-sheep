            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving some energy for future needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the reduced number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of the current situation and secure enough food for survival while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population has decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's important to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while ensuring my survival."
