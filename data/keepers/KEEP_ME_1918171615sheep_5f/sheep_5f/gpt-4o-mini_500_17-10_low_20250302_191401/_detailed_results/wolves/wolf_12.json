            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise."
