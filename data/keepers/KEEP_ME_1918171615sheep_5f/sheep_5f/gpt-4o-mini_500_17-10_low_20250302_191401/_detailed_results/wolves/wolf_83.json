            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.40 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 17 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a balanced way.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food. With more wolves around, I must also be competitive to ensure my survival, so a higher theta will help me catch prey more effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially dangerous environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 28.36 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with 31.78 sheep and 9 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or overhunting.
