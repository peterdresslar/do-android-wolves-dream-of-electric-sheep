            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to balance my need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's success without risking my own survival by hunting too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to a decline in sheep and ultimately threaten my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is less intense. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the stable wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the abundance of prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a dwindling pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to remain competitive while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a slightly lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.

This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for successful hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating more food availability.

However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.55 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the number of wolves remains the same, indicating competition for the sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.45, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still taking advantage of the increased prey. This strategy allows me to balance my chances of survival with the need to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A slightly higher intensity than my previous theta allows me to take advantage of the situation while still being mindful of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.75, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competing with other wolves, who are likely hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and the number of wolves remains the same. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment."
