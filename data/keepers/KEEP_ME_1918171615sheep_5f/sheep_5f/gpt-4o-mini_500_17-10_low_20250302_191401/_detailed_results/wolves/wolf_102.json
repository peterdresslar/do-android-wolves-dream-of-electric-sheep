            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still being effective in securing food. This approach allows me to conserve energy for future hunts while still being competitive in the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, given that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without risking too much energy expenditure.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more sustainable hunt. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough prey to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 10 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows for sustainable hunting while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves, competition for food is present but not overwhelming. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher.

This strategy allows me to survive in a more competitive environment.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial as the wolf population is increasing, and competition for food will be tougher.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts.
