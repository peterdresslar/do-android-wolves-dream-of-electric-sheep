By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey without overexerting myself, as the sheep population remains stable. This balance allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious of the other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food opportunities. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still contribute to the pack while also considering the risks of overexertion. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while not overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep numbers without risking depletion of resources.",

This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
