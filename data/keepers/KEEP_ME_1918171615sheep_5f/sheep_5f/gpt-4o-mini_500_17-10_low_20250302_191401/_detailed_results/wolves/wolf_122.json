            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting, ensuring I have enough resources for survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success."
