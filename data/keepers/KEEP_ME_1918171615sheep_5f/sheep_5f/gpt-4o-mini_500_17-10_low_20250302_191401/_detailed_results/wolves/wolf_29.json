            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting, but the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, I want to balance my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be more efficient in hunting without overexerting myself, ensuring I can still survive while also allowing for a sustainable approach to hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains the same.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, I want to balance my energy expenditure with the risk of competition from other wolves. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to capitalize on the abundance of prey while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because with 32.23 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when needed. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 39.41 sheep and 10 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75 allows me to be more aggressive in securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with 44.33 sheep and 11 wolves, the prey is abundant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the plentiful food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
