            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities to hunt without drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting might become more competitive. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the overall wolf population has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the resources available.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my intensity from 0.40 to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is increasing. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current sheep population at 29.60 and a stable wolf population, I need to balance my hunting efforts. Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or failure if the hunt doesn't go well. This way, I can still contribute to my pack's survival while managing my energy wisely.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while still being cautious.
