            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, which may be more aggressive in their hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion, which is crucial given the recent decrease in the wolf population."
