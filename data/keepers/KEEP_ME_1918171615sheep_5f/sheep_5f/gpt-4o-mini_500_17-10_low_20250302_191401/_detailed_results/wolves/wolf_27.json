            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and resources while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion, which is crucial given the recent trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall trend shows a decline in wolves, which may mean fewer opportunities in the future."
