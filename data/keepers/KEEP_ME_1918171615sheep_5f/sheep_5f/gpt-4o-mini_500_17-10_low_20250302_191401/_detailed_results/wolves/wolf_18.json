            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the wolf population remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
