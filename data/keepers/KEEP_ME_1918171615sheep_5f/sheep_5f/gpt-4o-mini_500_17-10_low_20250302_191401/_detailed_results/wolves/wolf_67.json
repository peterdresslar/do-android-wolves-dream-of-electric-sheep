By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy to survive in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still having the opportunity to hunt when necessary.",

By hunting at 0.50, I can still secure enough resources while conserving energy, especially given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in my pack, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food.

By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population remains stable. This balance will help ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting may be less successful if I go all out.
