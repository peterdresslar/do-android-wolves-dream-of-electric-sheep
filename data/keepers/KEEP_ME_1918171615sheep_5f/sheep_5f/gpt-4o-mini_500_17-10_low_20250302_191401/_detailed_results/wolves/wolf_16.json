            "I chose this theta because while the number of sheep is still relatively high, the increase in wolves suggests increased competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival in the long run."
