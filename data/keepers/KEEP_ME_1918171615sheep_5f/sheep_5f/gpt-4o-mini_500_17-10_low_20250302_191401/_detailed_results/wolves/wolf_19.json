            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves is still relatively high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
