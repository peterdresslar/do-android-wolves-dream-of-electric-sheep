            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
