By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the wolf population hasn't changed. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. This approach allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which means there is more food available. However, the number of wolves has not changed, indicating that competition remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, allowing me to adapt to the current environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher.
