            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion that could lead to vulnerability. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of the risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while ensuring my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for a successful hunt. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to take advantage of the available prey while being mindful of my own energy and survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival as I can adapt to the changing conditions and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with fewer wolves around, the competition for food is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch enough sheep to survive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking injury or exhaustion."
