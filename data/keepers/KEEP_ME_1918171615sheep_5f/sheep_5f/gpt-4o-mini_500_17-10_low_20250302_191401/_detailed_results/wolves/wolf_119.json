            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively with the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Since the wolf population has decreased, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy for future hunts while still being competitive. A theta of 0.65 allows me to take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in my pack suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential danger. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 24.02 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival. This balance allows me to be more efficient while still being mindful of the limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still conserving some energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food supply. With the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to hunt with slightly less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. A moderate approach may also help avoid overhunting, ensuring a sustainable food source for the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of the current situation and secure more food for myself while still being cautious, as the number of wolves is also increasing.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
