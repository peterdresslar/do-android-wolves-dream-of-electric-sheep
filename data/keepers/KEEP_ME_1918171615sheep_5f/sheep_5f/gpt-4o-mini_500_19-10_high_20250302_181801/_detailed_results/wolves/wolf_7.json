            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 2\n- Sheep population: 21.31\n- Wolf population: 9.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.500\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.37 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 2.1% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still being mindful of the sheep",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf growth and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help balance the ecosystem while still being cautious of the sheep numbers, ensuring that we do not deplete their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there is potential for increased hunting, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to ensure the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. This adjustment aims to promote wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and my wolf pack, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
