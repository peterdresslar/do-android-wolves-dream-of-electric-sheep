            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the current low wolf population. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also focusing on competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability over immediate gains.",
