            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at only 2.7% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that I should focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. Given the current wolf population, a slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population also relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species."
