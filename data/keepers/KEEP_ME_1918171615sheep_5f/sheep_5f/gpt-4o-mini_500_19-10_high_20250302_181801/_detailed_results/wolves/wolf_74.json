A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population being moderately high, reducing hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This balance is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a potential crash.",
