            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 9.23, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 50, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable at 0.18. To ensure the long-term survival of both species and allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem."
