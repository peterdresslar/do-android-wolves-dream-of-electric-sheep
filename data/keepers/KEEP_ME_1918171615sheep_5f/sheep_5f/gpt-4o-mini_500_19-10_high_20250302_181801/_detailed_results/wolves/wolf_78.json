            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, given the current low wolf population and the concerning number of sheep, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing sheep numbers to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while avoiding overexploitation. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations, promoting coexistence and allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 167.20, and the wolf population is low at 8.00. This suggests that we can increase our hunting intensity to take advantage of the abundant sheep while still allowing for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for growth in our population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
