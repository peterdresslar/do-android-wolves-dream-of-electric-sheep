            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the growing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for their recovery. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being unfavorable, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also giving the wolf population a chance to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population."
