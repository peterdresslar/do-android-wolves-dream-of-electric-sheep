            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that helps the sheep recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep further and to maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 6.63, which indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. With a high wolf population of 38, competition among wolves is likely increasing, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting. This adjustment reflects a gradual shift towards sustainability."
