A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden population crashes.",

It is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves."
