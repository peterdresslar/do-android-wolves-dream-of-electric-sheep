            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of sheep and avoids increased competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations."
