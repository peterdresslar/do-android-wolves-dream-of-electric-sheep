            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while managing the high wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing hunting intensity. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance and allow for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, enabling some reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem."
