            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and prevents further depletion of the sheep population.",

While I still need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species by avoiding overhunting."
