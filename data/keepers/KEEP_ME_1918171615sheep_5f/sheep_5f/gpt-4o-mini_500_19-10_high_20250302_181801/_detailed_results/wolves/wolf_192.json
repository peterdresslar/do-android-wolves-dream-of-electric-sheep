By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition among wolves is likely to increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for their recovery. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being unfavorable, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure both species can thrive in the long term."
