            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion.

A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. While there are many sheep per wolf, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 10% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition.
