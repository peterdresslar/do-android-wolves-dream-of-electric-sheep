A moderate approach will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
