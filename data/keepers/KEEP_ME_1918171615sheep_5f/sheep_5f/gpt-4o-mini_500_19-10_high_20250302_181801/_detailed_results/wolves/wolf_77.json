This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover without depleting their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach that promotes wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",

A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations."
