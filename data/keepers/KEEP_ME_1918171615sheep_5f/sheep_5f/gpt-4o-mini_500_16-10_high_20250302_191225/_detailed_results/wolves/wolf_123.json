However, given the relatively low wolf population, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a balance that allows for wolf growth. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for effective hunting while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",

This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and prevents further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population."
