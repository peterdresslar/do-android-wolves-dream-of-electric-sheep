A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
