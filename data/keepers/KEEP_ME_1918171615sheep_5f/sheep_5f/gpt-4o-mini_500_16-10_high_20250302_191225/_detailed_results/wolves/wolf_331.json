            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps prevent a crash in both populations."
