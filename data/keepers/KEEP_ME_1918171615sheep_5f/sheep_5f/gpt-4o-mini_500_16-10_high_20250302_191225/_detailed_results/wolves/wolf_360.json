            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the survival of my pack, but I must proceed cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current state of the ecosystem while still prioritizing long-term sustainability."
