            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 206\n- Sheep population: 38.44\n- Wolf population: 63.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.61 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 3.8% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about the wolf population growth. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious about the sheep numbers.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",

This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can begin to take advantage of the current low wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
