            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, there is room to increase hunting intensity slightly. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthier balance within the wolf pack. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability."
