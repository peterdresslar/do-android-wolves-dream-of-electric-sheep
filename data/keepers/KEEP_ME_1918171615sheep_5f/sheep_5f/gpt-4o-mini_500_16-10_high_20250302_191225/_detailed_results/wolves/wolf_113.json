            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
