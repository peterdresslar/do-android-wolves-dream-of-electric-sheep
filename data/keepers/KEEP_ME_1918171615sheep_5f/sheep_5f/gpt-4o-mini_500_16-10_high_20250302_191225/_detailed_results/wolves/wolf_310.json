            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious of the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While there are many sheep per wolf, the current state suggests that we should focus on maintaining a balance rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem."
