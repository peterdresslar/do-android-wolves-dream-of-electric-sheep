            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it is important to increase hunting intensity moderately to ensure sustainable coexistence. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf growth while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our growth while still allowing the sheep to recover. This balance will help sustain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance."
