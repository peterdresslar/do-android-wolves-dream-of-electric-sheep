            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy aims to prevent overexploitation of the sheep and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. This approach helps to ensure the long-term survival of both species by avoiding overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a sustainable balance.",
