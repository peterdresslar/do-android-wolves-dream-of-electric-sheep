            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and prevents the risk of depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. With the wolf population being moderately high, it is prudent to focus on competition and allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, which requires a cautious approach to hunting. While the wolf population is also low, increasing my hunting intensity too quickly could further deplete the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some growth in the wolf population while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population also relatively low, focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover.
