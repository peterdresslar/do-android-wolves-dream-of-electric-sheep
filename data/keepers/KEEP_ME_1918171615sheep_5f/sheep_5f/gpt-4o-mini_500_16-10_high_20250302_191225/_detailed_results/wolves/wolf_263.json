A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still considering the competition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure that the sheep can rebound while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
