            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta of 0.5 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment helps prevent overhunting and supports coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population also being relatively low, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while ensuring the wolf population does not grow too quickly. This gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, a gradual approach allows for potential growth without risking the depletion of sheep. This moderate theta helps maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover.
