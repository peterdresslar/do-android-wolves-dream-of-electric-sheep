            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, given the current concerns about sheep numbers and the low wolf population, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. While the sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests we could hunt more, maintaining a balance is crucial for long-term sustainability. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, which is essential for long-term sustainability. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
