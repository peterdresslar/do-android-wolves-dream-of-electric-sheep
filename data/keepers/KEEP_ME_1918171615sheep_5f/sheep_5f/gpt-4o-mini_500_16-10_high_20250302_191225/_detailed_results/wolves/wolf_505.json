            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 453\n- Sheep population: 14.02\n- Wolf population: 5.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.80 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.4% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overexploitation and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure that the sheep have a chance to rebound while also managing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable food source for the future while also gradually reducing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio being unfavorable, reducing hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
