            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the current high wolf population, it is essential to prioritize competition over hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to avoid sudden depletion of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests that focusing on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep is necessary to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the ecosystem without further depleting the sheep. This gradual adjustment will support long-term coexistence.",
