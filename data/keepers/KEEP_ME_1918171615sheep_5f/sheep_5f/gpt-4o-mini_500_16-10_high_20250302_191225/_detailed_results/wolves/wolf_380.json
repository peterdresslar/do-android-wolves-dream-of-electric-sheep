            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sheep recovery while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 12% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also keeping the wolf population in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition, and the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably."
