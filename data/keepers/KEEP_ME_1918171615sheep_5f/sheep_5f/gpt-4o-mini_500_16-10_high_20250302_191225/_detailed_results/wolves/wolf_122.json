            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 134\n- Sheep population: 91.66\n- Wolf population: 13.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.250\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 7.05 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 9.2% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is concerning. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous focus on competition with other wolves has allowed for some recovery, I need to be cautious about increasing hunting intensity too quickly. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a small adjustment towards hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growth potential of the wolf population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, with a relatively low wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity can help support our growth without risking a crash in the sheep population. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

However, the wolf population is also low, and there are many sheep per wolf, suggesting that a moderate increase in hunting intensity could be beneficial for wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This theta value reflects a balanced approach to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and there are many sheep per wolf, indicating that the ecosystem can support a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows for growth in the wolf population while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that I need to be cautious with my hunting intensity. While the wolf population is low and can support more hunting, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",

While the wolf population is low and could support more hunting, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate adjustment to 0.55 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. This adjustment supports my goal of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while also allowing for potential growth in the wolf population.",

A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This approach balances the need for immediate sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious, as the sheep numbers are concerning. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
