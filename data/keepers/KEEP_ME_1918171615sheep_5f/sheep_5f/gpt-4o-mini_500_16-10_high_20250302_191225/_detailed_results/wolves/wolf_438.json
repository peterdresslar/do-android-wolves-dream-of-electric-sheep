            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can help sustain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can begin to adapt to the changing conditions while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is also low, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the sustainability of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for cautious hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover.
