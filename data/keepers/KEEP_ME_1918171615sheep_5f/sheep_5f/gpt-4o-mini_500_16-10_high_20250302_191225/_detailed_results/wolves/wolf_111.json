A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition within our pack.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable.

A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden population crashes.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to the ecosystem",
