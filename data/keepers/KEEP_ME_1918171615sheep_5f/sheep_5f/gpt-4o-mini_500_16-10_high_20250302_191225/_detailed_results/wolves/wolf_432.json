By slightly increasing my focus on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without causing sudden changes that could lead to crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still considering the needs of the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
