            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. A theta of 0.5 will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment reflects the need for caution and sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability."
