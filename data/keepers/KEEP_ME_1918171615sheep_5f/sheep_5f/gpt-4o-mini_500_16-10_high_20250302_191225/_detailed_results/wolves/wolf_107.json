            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. It is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. This adjustment reflects the need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without causing further depletion of the sheep."
