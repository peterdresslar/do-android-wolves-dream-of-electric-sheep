            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition within our pack. This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population."
