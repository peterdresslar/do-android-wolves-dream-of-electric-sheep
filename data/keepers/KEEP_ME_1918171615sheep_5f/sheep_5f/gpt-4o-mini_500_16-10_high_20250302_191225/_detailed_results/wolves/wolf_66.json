A moderate theta will help maintain a sustainable balance between hunting and competing with other wolves.",

However, given the relatively low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes to maintain balance.",

By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
