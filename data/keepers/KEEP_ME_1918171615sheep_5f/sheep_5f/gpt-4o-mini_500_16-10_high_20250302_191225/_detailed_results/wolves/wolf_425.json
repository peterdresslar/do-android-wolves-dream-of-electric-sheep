            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. By setting theta at 0.5, I can maintain hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep numbers to recover, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations and prevents a crash in the ecosystem.",
