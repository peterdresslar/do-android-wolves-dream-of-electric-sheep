            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, caution is needed to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and my wolf pack, while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being moderately high, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to replenish their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
