            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is small and aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, there is a high sheep-to-wolf ratio. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This balance aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase allows for growth in my pack while still considering the long-term balance with the sheep."
