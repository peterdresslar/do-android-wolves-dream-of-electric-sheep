            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I also recognize the need to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase in hunting will help sustain our growth while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and my wolf pack while still competing with other wolves."
