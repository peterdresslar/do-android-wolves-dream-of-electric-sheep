            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and prevents a potential crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and prevents further depletion of the sheep population.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some reproduction among wolves while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help avoid further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is relatively low, I want to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, fostering a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some growth in the wolf population, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.16, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
