            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus more on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while being cautious about the wolf population growth. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
