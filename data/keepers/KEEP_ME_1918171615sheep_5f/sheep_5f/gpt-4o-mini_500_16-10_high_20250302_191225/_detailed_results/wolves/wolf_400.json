            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a wolf population that is moderately high, it is crucial to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
