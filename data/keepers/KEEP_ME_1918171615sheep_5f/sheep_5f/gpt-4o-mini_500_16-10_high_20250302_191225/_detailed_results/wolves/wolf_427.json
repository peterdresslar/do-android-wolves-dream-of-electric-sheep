            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the current high wolf population, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to stabilize and grow, which is vital for the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach will help prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
