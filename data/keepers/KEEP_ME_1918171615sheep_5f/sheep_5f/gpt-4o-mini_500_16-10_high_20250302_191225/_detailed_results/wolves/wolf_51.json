            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that I do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
