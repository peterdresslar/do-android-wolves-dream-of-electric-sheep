This adjustment supports the growth of the wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves, while still competing with other wolves to maintain a healthy pack."
