            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.

However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is currently low and requires careful management to avoid future declines.",

This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",

However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, the overall health of the ecosystem must be prioritized to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
