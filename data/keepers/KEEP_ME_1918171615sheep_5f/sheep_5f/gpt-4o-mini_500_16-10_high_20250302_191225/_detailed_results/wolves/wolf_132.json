A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further, ensuring both our survival and that of the sheep in the long run.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to stabilize and grow. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability.",
