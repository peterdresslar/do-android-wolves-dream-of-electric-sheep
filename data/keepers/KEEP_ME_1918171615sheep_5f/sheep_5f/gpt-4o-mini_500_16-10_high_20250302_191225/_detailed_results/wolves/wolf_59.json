This approach helps maintain a balance as the wolf population is currently low, and I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and could benefit from a slight increase in hunting intensity, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A small increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to ensure a balanced ecosystem."
