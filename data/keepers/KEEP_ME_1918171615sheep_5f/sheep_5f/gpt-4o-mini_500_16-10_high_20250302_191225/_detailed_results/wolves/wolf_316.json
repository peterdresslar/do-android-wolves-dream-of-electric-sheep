            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, a more cautious approach is warranted to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 11.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is moderately high, I need to balance hunting intensity to ensure long-term survival for both species. A theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations."
