            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow them to recover. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance while allowing for some hunting."
