By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and I need to prioritize their recovery while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help ensure that the sheep can regain their numbers, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on their dwindling numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem."
