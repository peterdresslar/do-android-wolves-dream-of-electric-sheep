            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population moderately high, it\u2019s important to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
