This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

While the wolf population is also low, I want to avoid overhunting and allow for a sustainable balance. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
