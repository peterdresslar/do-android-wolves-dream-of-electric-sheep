            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves, giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must remain cautious to avoid further depleting the sheep. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance."
