            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. With a moderately high wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
