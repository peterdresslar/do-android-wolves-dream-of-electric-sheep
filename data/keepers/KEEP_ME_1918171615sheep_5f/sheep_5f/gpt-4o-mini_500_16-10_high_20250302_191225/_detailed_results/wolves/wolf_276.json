            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep to rebuild their numbers. This gradual adjustment will also help manage competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A lower theta allows for more focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, which is crucial for long-term sustainability."
