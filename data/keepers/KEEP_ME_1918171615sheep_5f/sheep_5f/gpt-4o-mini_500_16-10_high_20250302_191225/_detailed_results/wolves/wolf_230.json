            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about the wolf population. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which will help reduce our numbers slightly and give the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which can help sustain the sheep population while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions."
