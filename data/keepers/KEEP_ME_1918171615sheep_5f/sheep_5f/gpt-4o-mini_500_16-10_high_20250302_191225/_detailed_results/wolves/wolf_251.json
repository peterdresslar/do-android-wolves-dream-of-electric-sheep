            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while still maintaining a moderate level of competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that we need to prioritize their recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, we can allow the sheep to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will help us compete with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
