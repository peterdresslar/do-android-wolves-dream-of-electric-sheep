A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and prevents further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some growth in the wolf population, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
