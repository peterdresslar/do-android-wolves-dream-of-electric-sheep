            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting that allows for some increase in sheep population while still enabling the wolf pack to grow. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to maintain wolf health while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow them to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep to regain their numbers while maintaining our own population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
