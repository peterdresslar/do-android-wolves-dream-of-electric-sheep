            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
