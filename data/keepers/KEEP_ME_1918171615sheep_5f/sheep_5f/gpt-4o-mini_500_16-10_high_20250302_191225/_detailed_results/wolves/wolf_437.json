            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is low, I want to avoid over-hunting and ensure a sustainable balance. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
