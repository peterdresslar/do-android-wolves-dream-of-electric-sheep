            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to balance hunting intensity with the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for growth without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
