            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to prevent overpopulation. However, I must balance this with the need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy and sustainable. A theta of 0.65 allows for increased hunting while still being cautious, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 9.00, there is still room for sustainable hunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that can help both populations recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
