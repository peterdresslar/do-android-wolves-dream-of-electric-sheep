            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while maintaining a focus on competition, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
