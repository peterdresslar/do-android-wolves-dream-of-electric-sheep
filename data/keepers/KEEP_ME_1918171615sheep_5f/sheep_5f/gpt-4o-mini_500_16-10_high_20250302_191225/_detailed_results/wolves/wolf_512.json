However, given the current low wolf population and the need for sustainability, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance our growth while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating the need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence and gives the sheep a chance to recover without drastically impacting the wolf population.",

A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability."
