            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still considering the sustainability of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while keeping an eye on the balance.",
