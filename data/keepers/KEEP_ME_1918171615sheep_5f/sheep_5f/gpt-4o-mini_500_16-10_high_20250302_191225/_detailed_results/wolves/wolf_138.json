A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This balance is crucial for long-term survival.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further."
