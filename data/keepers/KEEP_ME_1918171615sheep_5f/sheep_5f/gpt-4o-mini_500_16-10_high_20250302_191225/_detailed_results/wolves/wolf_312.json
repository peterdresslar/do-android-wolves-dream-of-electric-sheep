            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
