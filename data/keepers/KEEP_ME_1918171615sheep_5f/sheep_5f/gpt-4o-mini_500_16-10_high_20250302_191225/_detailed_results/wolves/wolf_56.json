            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which helps maintain the sheep population while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem."
