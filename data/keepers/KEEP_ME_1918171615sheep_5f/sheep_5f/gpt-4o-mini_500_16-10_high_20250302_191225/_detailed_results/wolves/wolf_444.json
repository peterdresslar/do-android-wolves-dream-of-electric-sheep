            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious of the sheep numbers, ensuring we do not deplete their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for increased hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I want to avoid drastic changes that could destabilize our pack. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably."
