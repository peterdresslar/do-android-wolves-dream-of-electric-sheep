            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is quite high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
