            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. This will help us grow our numbers while still allowing for some sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase will help us avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while we can afford to hunt more, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that sheep numbers do not deplete too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity to ensure our growth. However, I must do this cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for moderate hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for wolf population growth. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for a more aggressive hunting strategy without risking immediate depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, given the low wolf population, I must also be cautious and avoid drastic changes to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term survival of either species. A slight increase to 0.60 allows for more effective hunting while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, but caution is needed due to the potential for depletion. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for a balance between hunting and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for more hunting to maintain balance. However, given the low wolf population, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep and ensure our pack can grow. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious enough to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, the wolf population is low, allowing for some increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of sheep. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and supports both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound."
