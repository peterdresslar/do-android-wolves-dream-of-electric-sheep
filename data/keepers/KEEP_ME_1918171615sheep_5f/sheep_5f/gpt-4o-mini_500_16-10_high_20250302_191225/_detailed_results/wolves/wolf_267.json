            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while my previous theta allowed for some hunting, it is now crucial to adopt a more balanced approach. A theta of 0.5 will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This moderate intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem."
