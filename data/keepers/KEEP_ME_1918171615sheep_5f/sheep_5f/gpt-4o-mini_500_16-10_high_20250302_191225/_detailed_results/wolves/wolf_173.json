            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta of 0.5 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep."
