A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
