            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A small increase from my previous theta will help maintain a cautious approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population."
