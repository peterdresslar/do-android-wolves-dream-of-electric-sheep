            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our pack. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and ensures that we do not deplete our prey entirely."
