            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves.

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while being cautious about the wolf population. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A lower theta will allow for more competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, ensuring that I do not deplete the sheep population further while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery. This balance supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
