            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to sustain themselves. This approach aligns with the need for balance and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
