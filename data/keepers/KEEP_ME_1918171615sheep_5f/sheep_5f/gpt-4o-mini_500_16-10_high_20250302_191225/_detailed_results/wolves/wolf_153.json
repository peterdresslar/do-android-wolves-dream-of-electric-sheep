            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable level of wolf reproduction. A moderate theta value will help balance the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing some sustenance for the wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A moderate hunting intensity allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain balance and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in sheep numbers."
