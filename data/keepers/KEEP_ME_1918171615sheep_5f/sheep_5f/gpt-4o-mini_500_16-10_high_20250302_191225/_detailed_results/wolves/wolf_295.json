            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting sheep recovery while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
