            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that can help the sheep recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This adjustment reflects the need to prioritize long-term sustainability over immediate gains.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
