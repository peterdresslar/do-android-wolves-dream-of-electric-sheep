            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to promote wolf growth while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and could support more hunting, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and there is a significant sheep-to-wolf ratio, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can still hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers further. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the growth of the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A balanced approach is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depletion. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction while still being cautious, as the sheep numbers are concerning. A moderate increase in hunting intensity aligns with the current ecosystem dynamics and promotes a sustainable balance.",

This adjustment supports the growth of the wolf population while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence and gives the sheep a chance to recover.
