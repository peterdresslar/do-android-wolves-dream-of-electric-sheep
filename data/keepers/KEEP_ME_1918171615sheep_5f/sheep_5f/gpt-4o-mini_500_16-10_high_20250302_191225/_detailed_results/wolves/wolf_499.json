            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, we can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term survival for both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
