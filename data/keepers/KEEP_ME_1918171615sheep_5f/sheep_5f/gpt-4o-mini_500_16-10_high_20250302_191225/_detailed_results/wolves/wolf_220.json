            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the sheep further. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to adapt to the current unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio."
