            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I need to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious to avoid further depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balance that encourages recovery of the sheep while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species."
