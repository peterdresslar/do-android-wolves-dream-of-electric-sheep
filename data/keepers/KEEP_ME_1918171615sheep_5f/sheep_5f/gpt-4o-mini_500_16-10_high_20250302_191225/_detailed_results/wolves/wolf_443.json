            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and there are many sheep per wolf, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depleting the sheep. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is low and can support more hunting, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high relative to the wolf population, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for growth without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, given the current low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
