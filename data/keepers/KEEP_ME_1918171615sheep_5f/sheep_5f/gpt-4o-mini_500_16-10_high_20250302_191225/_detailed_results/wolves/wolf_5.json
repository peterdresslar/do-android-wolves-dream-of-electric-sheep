            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 3\n- Sheep population: 19.04\n- Wolf population: 8.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.500\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 2.38 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 1.9% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is relatively low, which may present opportunities for growth.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1.

A lower theta allows for competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
