            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 29, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. With a high wolf population of 57, the competition among wolves is increasing, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further."
