            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, while still maintaining some hunting to support our needs. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
