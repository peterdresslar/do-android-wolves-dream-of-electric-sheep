            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By reducing hunting intensity, I can help ensure that the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will also help mitigate competition among wolves as we adapt to the changing conditions."
