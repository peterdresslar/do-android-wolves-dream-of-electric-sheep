            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction among wolves while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",

A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This balance will help prevent a crash in the sheep population and ensure long-term survival for both species."
