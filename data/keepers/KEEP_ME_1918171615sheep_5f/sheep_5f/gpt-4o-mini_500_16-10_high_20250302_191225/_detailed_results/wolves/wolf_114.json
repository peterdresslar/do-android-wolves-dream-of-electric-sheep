            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover while still maintaining a sustainable level of wolf reproduction. A moderate theta value will help balance the competition among wolves and the need for sheep, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which may help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability."
