            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure the sustainability of both species. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for more hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, the wolf population is relatively low, so I must balance hunting intensity to allow for wolf growth while ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for increased hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow them to recover. While there are many sheep per wolf, I want to avoid depleting the sheep further and ensure a sustainable balance. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence."
