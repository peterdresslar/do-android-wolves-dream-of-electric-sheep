            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.

This gradual adjustment helps avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting, but it remains cautious to ensure the sheep can recover. This approach balances the immediate need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is also low, maintaining a balance is crucial to ensure both species can thrive in the long term. A gradual increase in hunting intensity can be considered later as sheep numbers stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.64, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover.
