To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while managing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while the wolf population is also low, a cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep."
