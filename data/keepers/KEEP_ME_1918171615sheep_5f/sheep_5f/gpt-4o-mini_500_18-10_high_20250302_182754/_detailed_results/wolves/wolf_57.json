            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
