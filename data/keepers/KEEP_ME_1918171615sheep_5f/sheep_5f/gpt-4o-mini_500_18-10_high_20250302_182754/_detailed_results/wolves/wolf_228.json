            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent overhunting and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary, but caution is paramount to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing drastic changes that could lead to further depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the current ecosystem state and helps avoid further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
