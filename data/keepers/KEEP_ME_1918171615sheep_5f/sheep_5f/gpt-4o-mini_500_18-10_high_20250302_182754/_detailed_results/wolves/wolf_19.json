            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at only 10.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta will allow for more competition among wolves, which may reduce our numbers slightly but will give the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to thrive again. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem."
