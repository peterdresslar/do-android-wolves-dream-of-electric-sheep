A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports the growth of our wolf population without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance."
