            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This will help us grow our numbers while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.60 allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while we can increase our hunting intensity, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence. This value balances the need to support wolf population growth while ensuring that sheep numbers do not deplete too rapidly.",
