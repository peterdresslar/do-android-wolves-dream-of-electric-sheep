            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A moderate theta value allows for a balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment helps avoid overhunting and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This cautious approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
