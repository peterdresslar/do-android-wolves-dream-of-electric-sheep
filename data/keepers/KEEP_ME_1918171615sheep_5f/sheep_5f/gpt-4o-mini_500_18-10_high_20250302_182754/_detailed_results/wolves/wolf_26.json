            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is moderately high, a balanced approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.45 reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem."
