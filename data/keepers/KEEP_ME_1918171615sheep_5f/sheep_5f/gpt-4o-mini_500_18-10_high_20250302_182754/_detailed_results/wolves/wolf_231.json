            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. While the wolf population is low, increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing the balance of the ecosystem. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound."
