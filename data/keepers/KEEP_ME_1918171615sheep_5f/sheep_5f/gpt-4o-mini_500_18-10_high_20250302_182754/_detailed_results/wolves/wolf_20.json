            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and it is crucial to prioritize their recovery to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep to regain their numbers while maintaining our own population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
