            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I want to allow for some growth while still maintaining a balance. A moderate theta allows for gradual hunting while keeping an eye on the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
