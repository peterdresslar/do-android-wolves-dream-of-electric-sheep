            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a wolf population that is moderately high, it is prudent to adopt a more balanced approach. This theta allows for some hunting to sustain our population while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. Gradual adjustments are key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species."
