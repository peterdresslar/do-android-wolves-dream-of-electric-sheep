However, I must remain cautious as the sheep numbers are concerning, and a moderate approach will help ensure sustainable coexistence while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",

A moderate theta value of 0.60 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population while also prioritizing the long-term health of the sheep. This balance helps prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
