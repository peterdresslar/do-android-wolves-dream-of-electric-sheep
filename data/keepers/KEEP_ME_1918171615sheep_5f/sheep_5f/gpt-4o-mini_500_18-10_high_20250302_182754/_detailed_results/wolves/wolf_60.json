            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. It is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and allow the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
