            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach also acknowledges the high wolf population and the need to reduce competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still focusing on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, promoting their growth and ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the sustainability of the ecosystem. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover."
