            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the wolf population being high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf health. This gradual adjustment will help the sheep recover without putting too much pressure on their dwindling numbers."
