            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently concerning, and while there are many sheep per wolf, a more cautious approach is warranted to prevent over-depletion. This theta allows for increased hunting intensity while still considering the need for sustainability and the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and while my pack is strong, we need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving the sheep a chance to recover."
