            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the growing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
