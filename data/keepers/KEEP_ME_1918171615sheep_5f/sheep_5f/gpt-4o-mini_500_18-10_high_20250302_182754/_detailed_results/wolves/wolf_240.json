            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A gradual increase in hunting will help sustain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to avoid depleting their numbers further. However, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that we can still hunt moderately without jeopardizing our long-term survival. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance."
