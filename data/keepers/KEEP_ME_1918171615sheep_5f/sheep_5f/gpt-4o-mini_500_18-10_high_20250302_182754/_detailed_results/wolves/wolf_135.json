            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance without causing sudden crashes in either population."
