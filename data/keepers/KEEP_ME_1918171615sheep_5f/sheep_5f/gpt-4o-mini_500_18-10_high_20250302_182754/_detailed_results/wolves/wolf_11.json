            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there is a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, given the low wolf population, a moderate approach will help ensure our numbers can grow while still allowing the sheep to recover. This balance supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 8.96, there is still room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
