            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep population to stabilize and recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow us to focus on competing with other wolves and give the sheep a chance to replenish their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. With a high wolf population, increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing long-term survival for both species. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, enabling the sheep to recover while still considering the needs of the wolf population. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both species.",
