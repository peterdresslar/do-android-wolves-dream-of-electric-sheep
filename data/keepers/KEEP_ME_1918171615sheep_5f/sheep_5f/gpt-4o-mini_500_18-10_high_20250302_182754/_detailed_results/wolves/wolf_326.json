            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting our prey. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while managing the high wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
