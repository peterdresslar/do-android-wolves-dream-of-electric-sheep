            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too aggressive for the current conditions. A slight increase from my previous value allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash."
