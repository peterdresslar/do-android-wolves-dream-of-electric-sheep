            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and supports long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term sustainability."
