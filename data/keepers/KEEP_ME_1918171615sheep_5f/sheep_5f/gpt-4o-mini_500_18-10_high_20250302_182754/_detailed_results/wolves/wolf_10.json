With the sheep population at a concerning level and the wolf population relatively low, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a sustainable increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, which are concerning. A moderate increase in hunting will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure sustainability. However, given the relatively low wolf population, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes to allow for gradual adaptation and coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 balances the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can thrive, thus supporting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aims to ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to reduce hunting intensity to allow sheep to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep."
