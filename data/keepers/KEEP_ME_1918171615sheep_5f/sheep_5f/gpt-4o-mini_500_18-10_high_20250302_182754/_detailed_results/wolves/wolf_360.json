To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, which can help sustain the sheep population while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A gradual increase in hunting intensity will allow for some growth in the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. Maintaining a theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than aggressive hunting, which will help the sheep population stabilize and potentially recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still being cautious to prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also relatively low, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery.
