            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure the sustainability of both species. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is still relatively low. This theta allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while addressing the current sheep surplus.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, I need to prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
