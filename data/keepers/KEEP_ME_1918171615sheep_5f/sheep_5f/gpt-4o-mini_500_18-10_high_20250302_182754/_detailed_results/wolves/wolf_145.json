            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also being mindful of the moderately high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase their population. This balance will help sustain both species in the long run.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the current sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
