            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and remain sustainable. A gradual increase in theta allows us to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I will do so cautiously to ensure we maintain a balance and allow for sustainable growth in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While there are many sheep per wolf, a moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population is concerningly low, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is still room for cautious hunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still maintaining enough hunting intensity to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the sheep further. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
