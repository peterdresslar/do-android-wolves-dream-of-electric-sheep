            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating that while I can increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase allows for a balance between growth in the wolf population and the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there are many sheep per wolf, a more moderate approach will allow for sustainable coexistence. This theta value reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that promotes wolf growth while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while there is potential for increased hunting due to the high sheep-to-wolf ratio, I must prioritize the long-term survival of both species. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a moderate increase in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent overpopulation and ensure the sustainability of both species. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still low and requires careful management.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that while I can increase hunting intensity, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate over-depletion of sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for increased hunting without immediate risk of depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for moderate hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for the wolf population to grow. A balanced approach will help maintain sustainability in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while remaining cautious. This adjustment promotes wolf population growth without risking the depletion of sheep, maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for moderate hunting to prevent overpopulation while still allowing for the wolf population to grow. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, allowing for increased hunting intensity without immediate risk of depletion. With 16.50 sheep per wolf, there is room for sustainable hunting that can help our wolf population grow. However, I will keep the increase moderate to ensure we do not over-exploit the sheep and maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for more hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf pack. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
