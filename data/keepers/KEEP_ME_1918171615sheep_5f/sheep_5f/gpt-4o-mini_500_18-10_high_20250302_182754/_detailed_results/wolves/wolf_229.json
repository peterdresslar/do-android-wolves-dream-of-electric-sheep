            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. With the wolf population also being relatively low, it is important to focus on competition and allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent depletion of resources."
