            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a high wolf population, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This cautious approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
