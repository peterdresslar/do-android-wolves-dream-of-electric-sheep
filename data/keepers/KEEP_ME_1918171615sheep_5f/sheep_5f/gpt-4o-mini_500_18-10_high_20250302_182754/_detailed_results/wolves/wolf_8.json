            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.\nYou can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.\n\nUnderstanding theta:\n- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep\n- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence\n- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover\n\nWisdom from generations of wolves:\n- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity\n- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity\n- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective\n- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions\n- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions\n\nCurrent ecosystem state:\n- Time step: 37\n- Sheep population: 46.74\n- Wolf population: 66.00\n- Your previous theta: 0.300\n- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.71 sheep per wolf\n- Sheep population is at 4.7% of maximum capacity\n\nEcosystem observations:\n- The wolf population is quite high, which may lead to increased competition.\n- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.\n- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.\n\nYour objectives as a wise wolf:\n1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep\n2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions\n3.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it is essential to prioritize the long-term balance of the ecosystem. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on competition among wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, indicating a need for caution in hunting. However, the wolf population is also low, and there are many sheep per wolf, suggesting that a moderate increase in hunting intensity could support wolf growth while still allowing for sheep recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between these competing needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and with a low wolf population, there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for balance and the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent overpopulation. However, with a relatively low wolf population, I want to ensure we can sustain our numbers while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate adjustment to 0.45 allows for some hunting while prioritizing balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help us capitalize on the current abundance of sheep while still being cautious to avoid over-depletion. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf growth without jeopardizing the sheep",
