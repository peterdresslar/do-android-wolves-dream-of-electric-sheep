            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to grow. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term sustainability of both species."
