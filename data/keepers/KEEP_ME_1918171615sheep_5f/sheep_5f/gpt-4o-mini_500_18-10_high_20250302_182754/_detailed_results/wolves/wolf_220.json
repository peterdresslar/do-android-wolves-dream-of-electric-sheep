            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for a balanced approach. A moderate theta of 0.5 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy aims to prevent over-depletion of the sheep and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in our ecosystem."
