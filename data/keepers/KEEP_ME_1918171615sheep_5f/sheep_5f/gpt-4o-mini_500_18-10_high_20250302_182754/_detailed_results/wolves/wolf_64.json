A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
