            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and the wolf population is low, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our growth while still being cautious about the sheep numbers, ensuring we do not deplete their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
