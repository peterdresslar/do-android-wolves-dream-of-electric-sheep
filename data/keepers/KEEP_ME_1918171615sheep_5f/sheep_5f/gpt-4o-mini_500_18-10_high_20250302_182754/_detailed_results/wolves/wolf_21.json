A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
