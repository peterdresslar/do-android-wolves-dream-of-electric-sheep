            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with a high wolf population, we need to focus on reducing competition among ourselves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and with the current high wolf population, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This will allow the sheep to recover and prevent a collapse of their population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while allowing for some competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
