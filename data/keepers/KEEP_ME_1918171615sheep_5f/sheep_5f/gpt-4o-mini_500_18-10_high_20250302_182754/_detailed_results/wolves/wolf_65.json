A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing further depletion of the sheep population while we focus on competition among wolves.",

This approach aims to maintain a sustainable balance without risking a crash in either population.",

By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
