            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is low, and I want to ensure sustainable growth for both species. A moderate increase in hunting will help balance the ecosystem while avoiding drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population while still maintaining some level of competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being relatively high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
