            "With 14 sheep and 10 wolves, the population seems stable but tight. By reducing hunting intensity, I conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. A lower theta (0.30) means I'll hunt more selectively and efficiently, which could help long-term survival by not depleting resources too quickly.",
            "With wolf population decreasing and sheep population increasing, I need to hunt more aggressively than my previous low-intensity approach. However, I won't go to full intensity to conserve energy and avoid potential conflicts with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows me to secure food while maintaining strategic caution."
