            "With a stable wolf population and moderate sheep numbers, I'll reduce hunting intensity to conserve energy and prevent potential population collapse. A lower theta (0.30) means less aggressive hunting, which could help maintain ecological balance and reduce competition among wolves.",
            "With wolf population decreasing and sheep population increasing, I'll moderate my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still securing food, balancing survival needs with the ecosystem's current dynamics."
