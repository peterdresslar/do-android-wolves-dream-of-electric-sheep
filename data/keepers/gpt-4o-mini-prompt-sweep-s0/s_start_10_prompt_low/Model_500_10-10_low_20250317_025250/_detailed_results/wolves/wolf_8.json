            "I chose this theta because it balances the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy. With the current number of sheep and wolves remaining stable, a moderate intensity allows me to contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is lower. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and potential injury, ensuring my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity may help conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This approach also reduces competition with other wolves, as they will likely hunt at maximum intensity. By being strategic, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still survive while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while being mindful of the competition and my own energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased.
