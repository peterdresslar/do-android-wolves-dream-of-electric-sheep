            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.25 allows me to be more strategic without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity (theta=1) could lead to competition and overhunting. By choosing a moderate intensity (theta=0.5), I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is rising. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure I can catch enough food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This adjustment allows me to adapt to the current situation and the increased wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains high. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the overall situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a dwindling prey environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves. A balanced approach helps ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's needs.
