            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still benefiting from the available resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 57.15, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure I can secure enough food for survival, while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a potentially scarce situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the wolf population remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around and fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment.
