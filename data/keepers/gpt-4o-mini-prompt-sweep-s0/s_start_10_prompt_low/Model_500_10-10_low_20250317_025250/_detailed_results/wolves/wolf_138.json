This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means hunting at a lower intensity can help ensure I have enough resources without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. It also helps me avoid drawing too much attention from other wolves, who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining constant, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. A lower intensity allows me to maintain my strength while still participating in hunts, as the competition among wolves is high. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
