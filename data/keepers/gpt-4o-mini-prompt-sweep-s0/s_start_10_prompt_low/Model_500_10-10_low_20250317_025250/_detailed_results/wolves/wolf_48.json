            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary or sustainable. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing conditions and ensure my survival without risking too much in a potentially scarce situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be more aggressive. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable hunting opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly.
