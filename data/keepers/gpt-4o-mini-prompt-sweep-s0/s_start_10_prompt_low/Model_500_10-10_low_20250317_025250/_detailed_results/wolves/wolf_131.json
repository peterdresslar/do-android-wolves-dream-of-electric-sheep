            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which indicates that hunting may not be as fruitful as before. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be moderately aggressive while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the number of wolves decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while avoiding overexertion and competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.65 allows me to take advantage of the current situation without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still being cautious. This allows me to compete effectively with other wolves without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",

However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing and wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition for resources and allowing me to adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep being relatively high compared to the stable wolf population, a slightly increased hunting intensity will allow me to take advantage of the available resources while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 14 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This balance allows for sustainability in hunting while still being competitive.",

By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion. This strategy balances my need for food with the risk of competition from other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.40, I can take advantage of the growing sheep population without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting may become more competitive. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch prey.
