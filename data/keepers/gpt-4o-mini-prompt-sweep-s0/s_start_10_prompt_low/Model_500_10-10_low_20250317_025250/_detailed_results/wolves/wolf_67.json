            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can still contribute to the pack's success while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slightly higher intensity than before will help me stay competitive without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for dwindling resources. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more aggressive in my hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that there are enough sheep left for future hunts while also conserving energy for myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. Hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival amidst the declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high.
