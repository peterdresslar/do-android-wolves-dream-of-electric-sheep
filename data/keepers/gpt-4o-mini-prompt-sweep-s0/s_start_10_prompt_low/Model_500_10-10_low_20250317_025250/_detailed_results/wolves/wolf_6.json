            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep and wolves is stable, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy reduces competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and attracting attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity while still ensuring I get enough food. This approach helps me conserve energy and reduces the risk of confrontation with other wolves, which is crucial for my survival given the recent decline in their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 8 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This way, I can avoid overexertion and still contribute to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while conserving energy for future hunts. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to balance the risk of competition while still ensuring I can secure enough food for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food resources. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I have enough energy to compete with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with five wolves, competition for food is significant. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
