            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more competitive without exhausting myself too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With more wolves competing for the same limited resources, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough food while avoiding overexertion and risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting intensity needs to be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's needs while being mindful of the dwindling prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexploiting the remaining sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may also be struggling. This balance allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or danger from competing wolves."
