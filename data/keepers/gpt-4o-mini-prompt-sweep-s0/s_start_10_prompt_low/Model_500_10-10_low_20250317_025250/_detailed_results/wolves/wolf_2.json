With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's important to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still contribute to the pack while also preserving my energy for future hunts.",

By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success.
