            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the changing conditions and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the risks involved in hunting more aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of the current situation and improve my chances of securing food. However, I must balance this with the risk of overexertion, as other wolves are also hunting and competition is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexploitation of the remaining sheep, while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and increased risk of injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the wolf population decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself.
