            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population and a decrease in sheep, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition among wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food while balancing the risk of overhunting. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be more aggressive than my previous choice, adapting to the current situation without exhausting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources without overexerting myself. This way, I can maintain my energy for future hunts while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food, but the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance will help ensure my survival in the current environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the number of wolves remains the same.
