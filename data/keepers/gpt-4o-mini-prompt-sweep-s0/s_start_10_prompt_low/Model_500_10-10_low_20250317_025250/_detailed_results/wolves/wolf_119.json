This way, I can conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment.",

This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",

By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while also conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a need for caution. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a successful hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be adjusting their strategies.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I need to be more competitive in hunting to ensure my survival. A higher intensity will help me secure enough food while still being mindful of the overall wolf population decline.",
