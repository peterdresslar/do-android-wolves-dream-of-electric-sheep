            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to secure food. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for survival with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being part of the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to secure enough food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough prey for survival. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between being aggressive enough to secure food while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can be more competitive against other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
