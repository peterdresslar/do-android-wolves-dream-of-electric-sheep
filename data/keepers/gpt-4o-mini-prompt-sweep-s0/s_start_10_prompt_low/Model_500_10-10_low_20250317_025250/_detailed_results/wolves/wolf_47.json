            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population has increased recently. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for dwindling resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting efforts. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or danger from competing wolves.",

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the higher sheep count while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey.
