            "I chose this theta because the increase in wolf population suggests that competition for food is intensifying. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure food while still conserving energy for future hunts, balancing the need to survive with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tighter competition for food. With more wolves around, increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.75 will help me secure enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
