            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population and the decrease in sheep, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be more aggressive in hunting while still conserving some energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary to secure enough food. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may also be struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment where resources are becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a scarcity of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the dwindling sheep population while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be competing for food.
