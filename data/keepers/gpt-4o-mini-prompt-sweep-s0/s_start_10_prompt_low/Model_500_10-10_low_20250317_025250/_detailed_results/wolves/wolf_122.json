            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of this situation while still conserving energy in case the competition from other wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, increasing my hunting intensity slightly will improve my chances of securing a meal without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 12 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach balances the need to hunt with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",

By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food is still present. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher sheep numbers while still being cautious, as hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or detection by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current sheep population at 38.80 and a stable wolf population, it is wise to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the competition and ensures I can hunt efficiently without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
