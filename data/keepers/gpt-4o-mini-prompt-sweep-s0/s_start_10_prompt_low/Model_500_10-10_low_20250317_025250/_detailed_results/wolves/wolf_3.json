            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy reduces the risk of competition with other wolves and helps ensure my survival in a stable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more strategic, allowing me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. By being more selective, I can still secure food while minimizing risk.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By choosing a moderate hunting intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself."
