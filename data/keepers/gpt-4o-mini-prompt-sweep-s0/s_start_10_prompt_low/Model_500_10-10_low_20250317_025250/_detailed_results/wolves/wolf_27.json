        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure food without overexerting myself. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. However, the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's survival while adapting to the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By reducing my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is still high.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may also be hunting aggressively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available sheep while still conserving energy, as the population of wolves is declining. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy may help me survive longer until the sheep population stabilizes."
