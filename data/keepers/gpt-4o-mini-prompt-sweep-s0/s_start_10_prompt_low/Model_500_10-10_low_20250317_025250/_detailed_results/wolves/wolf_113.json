By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion without a guarantee of success. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being opportunistic.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, given the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",
