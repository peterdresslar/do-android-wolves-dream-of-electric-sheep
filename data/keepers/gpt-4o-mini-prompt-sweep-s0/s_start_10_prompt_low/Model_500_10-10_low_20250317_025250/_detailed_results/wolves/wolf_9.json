            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep and wolves is stable, indicating that hunting at full intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don't exhaust myself or risk injury. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more food opportunities. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition with other wolves. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased.
