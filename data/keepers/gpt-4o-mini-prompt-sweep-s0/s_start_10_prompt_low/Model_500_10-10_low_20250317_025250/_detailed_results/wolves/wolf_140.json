With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being competitive against other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity needs to be higher to ensure a successful hunt. However, I want to balance my energy expenditure and avoid overexertion, especially since the number of wolves remains the same. A theta of 0.70 allows me to be competitive without risking exhaustion.",
