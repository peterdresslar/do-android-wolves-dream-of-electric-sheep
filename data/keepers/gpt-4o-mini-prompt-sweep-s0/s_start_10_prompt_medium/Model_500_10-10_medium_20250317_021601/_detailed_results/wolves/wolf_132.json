            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and my previous theta was quite low. A moderate increase to 0.3 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that the sheep can recover. This approach balances my need to maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
