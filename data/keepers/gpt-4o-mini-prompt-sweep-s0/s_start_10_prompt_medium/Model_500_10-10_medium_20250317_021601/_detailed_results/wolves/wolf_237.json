            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it's important to avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, thus promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.73, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help the sheep population stabilize while also allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while giving sheep a chance to increase in numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.27, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
