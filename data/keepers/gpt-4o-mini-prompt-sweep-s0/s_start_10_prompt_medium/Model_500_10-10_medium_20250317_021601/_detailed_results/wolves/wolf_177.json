            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 92, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm both populations. A moderate increase in theta to 0.4 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.04. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a rapid decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
