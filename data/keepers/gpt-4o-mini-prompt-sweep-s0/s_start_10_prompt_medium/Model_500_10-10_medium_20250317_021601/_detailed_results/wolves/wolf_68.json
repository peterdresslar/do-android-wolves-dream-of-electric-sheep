            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced strategy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.45, I can balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to increase in number, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be kept moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population. This strategy promotes sustainability and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.53, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, avoiding overexploitation."
