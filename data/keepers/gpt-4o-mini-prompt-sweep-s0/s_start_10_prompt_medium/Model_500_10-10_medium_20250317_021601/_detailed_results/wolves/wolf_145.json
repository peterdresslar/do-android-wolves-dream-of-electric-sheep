        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to maintain the wolf population. This adjustment supports both the immediate need for food and the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a moderate approach will help maintain balance while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to maintain a sustainable balance."
