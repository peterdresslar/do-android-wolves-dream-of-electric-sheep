            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is key to sustaining both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still ensuring the sheep population can recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in response to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain hunting intensity while also considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves at this lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance."
