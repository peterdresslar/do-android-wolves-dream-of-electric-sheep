            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.850 was effective for reproduction, it risks depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.53, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, avoiding overexploitation while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.98, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.
