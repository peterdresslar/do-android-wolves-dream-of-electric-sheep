            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This balance will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 98.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus slightly more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This approach will help maintain a balance, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a healthier ecosystem balance."
