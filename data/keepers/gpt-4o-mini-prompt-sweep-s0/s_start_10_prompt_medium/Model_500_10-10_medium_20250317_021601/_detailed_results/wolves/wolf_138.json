            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently high at 225.31, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta was 0.450, I want to slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers. This will help ensure a sustainable balance between our populations, as the wolf population is already relatively high. A gradual adjustment will help maintain harmony in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
