            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.842 indicates a strong hunting approach, I need to gradually reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.72 reflects a moderate approach that balances my need to hunt with the necessity of ensuring the sheep can thrive, thus supporting long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.720 indicates a strong hunting approach, it is essential to shift towards a more balanced strategy to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing sheep to repopulate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. It is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while minimizing competition with other wolves. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also addressing the competition among wolves.
