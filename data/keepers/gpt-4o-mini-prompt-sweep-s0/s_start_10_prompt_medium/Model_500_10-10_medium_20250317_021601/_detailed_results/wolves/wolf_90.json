            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.12. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. This moderate approach will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.53, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the necessity of maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.98, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase, while also addressing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on maintaining my wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
