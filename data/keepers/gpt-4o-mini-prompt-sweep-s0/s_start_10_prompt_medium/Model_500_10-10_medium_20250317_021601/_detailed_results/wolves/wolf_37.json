            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 155.18, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This value reflects a balance between maintaining a sustainable sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack can thrive. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.88, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A moderate approach will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is potential for growth. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance."
