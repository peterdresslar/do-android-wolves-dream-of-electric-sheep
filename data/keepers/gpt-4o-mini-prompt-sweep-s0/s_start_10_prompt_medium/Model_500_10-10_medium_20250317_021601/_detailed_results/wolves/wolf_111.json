            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I focus less on hunting and more on competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also addressing the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt a bit more while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population rebound while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to avoid sudden changes and promote long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.88, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of the ecosystem.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.80, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we allow the sheep to increase. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover without depleting it further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.23, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also reflects a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep, considering the current wolf population is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.70, which is only 3.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will also prevent overhunting and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.25, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still support the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.09, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.
