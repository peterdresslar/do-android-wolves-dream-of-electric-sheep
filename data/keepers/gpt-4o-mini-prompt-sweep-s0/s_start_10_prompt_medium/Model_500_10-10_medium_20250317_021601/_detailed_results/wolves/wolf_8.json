            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations, avoiding depletion of the sheep and allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a balanced approach is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep and ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem."
