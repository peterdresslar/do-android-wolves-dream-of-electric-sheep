            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is also growing. A theta of 0.78 strikes a balance between ensuring our survival through hunting while allowing the sheep population to remain sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
