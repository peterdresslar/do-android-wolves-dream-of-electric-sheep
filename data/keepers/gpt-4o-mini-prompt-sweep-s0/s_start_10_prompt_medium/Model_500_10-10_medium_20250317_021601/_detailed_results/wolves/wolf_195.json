            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for healthy reproduction among wolves while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment is gradual and aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our wolf pack does not overextend itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.73, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.11, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the wolves"
