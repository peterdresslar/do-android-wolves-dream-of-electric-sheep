This adjustment reflects the need to prioritize long-term survival over immediate gains.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 119, a slight increase in theta to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden population crashes.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting.",

A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our wolf pack remains sustainable. This gradual adjustment will help create a more balanced ecosystem over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.64, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
