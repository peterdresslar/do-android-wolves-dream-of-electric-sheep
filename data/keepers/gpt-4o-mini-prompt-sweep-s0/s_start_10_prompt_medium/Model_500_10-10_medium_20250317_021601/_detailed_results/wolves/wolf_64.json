            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is also significant, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need to balance the wolf population, which is currently high. This adjustment helps maintain a dynamic equilibrium in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.36, which is only 3.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can balance the need for hunting with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem, avoiding over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.53, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem."
