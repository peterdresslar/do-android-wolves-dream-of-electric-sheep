            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps to balance the needs of the wolf population with the recovery of the sheep, ensuring we do not deplete their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual increase in theta will help avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for healthy reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 6.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
