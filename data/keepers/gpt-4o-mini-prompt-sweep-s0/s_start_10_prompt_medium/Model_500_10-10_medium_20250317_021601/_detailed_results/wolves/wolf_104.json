However, with the wolf population at 98, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. A gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.18. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting but prioritizes the long-term balance and sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 10.06, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 77, I need to be cautious about competition among wolves. A slight increase in theta to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.29, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need for gradual adjustments.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a moderate approach that balances the need for wolf survival while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and I need to focus on allowing them to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help me balance hunting with the need to compete with other wolves, ensuring sustainability in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well.

A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",

This small increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious optimism about the potential for sheep population growth, while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.88, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that overhunting could lead to a severe decline in sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term food source. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.44, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 12.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
