            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain some hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate adjustment to 0.65 allows for sustainable hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring that both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a healthy wolf population in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while allowing the sheep to regain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity too much, it could lead to their depletion. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.53, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity too much could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a modest increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.98, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition rather than hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.35. This allows for a slight increase in hunting while still being cautious, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.19. This indicates a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance between the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a significant decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the ecosystem."
