            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual approach is essential to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.40 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and aims for a balanced coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population."
