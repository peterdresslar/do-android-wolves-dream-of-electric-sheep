            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 92, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in hunting intensity will allow me to adapt to the current conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden crashes in either population."
