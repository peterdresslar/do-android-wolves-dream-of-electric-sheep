However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.77, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm the wolf population. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover without overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep bounce back while also managing competition with other wolves."
