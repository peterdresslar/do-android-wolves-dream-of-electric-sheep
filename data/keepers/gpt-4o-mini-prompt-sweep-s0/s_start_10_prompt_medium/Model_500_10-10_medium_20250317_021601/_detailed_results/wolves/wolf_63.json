            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to ensure sustainability and avoid over-exploitation of the sheep. This adjustment allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is important to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, ultimately supporting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf pack remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to gradually recover. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
