However, given the current wolf population, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a sustainable balance.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that supports the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.36, which is only 3.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.12. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta to 0.30 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.53, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both hunting and the recovery of sheep, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.98, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population increase while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
