            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 63.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to keep the ecosystem balanced.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 18, which is relatively stable, I want to avoid overhunting and allow for sustainable coexistence. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep can recover. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring sustainability. This value reflects a balance that supports both the wolf population and the sheep, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for sustainable coexistence, a moderate approach is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that they need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes."
