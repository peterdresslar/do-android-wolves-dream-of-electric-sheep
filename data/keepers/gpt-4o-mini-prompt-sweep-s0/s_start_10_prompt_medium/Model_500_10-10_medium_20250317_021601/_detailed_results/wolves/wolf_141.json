            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. Gradually adjusting my theta downwards will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if necessary. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.77, it is wise to adopt a moderate hunting intensity to ensure that both populations can thrive. This theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep to avoid depleting their numbers further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. A slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction, but I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This moderate adjustment allows for a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves."
