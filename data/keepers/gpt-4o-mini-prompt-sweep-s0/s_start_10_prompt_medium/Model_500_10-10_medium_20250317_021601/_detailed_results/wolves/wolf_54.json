            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 134.80, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also growing, and a sudden spike in hunting could deplete the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.72 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 78, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.36, which is only 3.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still prioritizing the sheep"
