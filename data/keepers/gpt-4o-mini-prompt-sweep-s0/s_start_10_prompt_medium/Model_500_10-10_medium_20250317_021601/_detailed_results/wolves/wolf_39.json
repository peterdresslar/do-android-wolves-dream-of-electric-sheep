            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 62.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep, so I am making a moderate adjustment rather than a drastic one. This will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also present, I need to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 78, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 28.0% of maximum capacity, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, while also considering the current wolf population of 106. This approach promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and supports long-term sustainability for both species."
