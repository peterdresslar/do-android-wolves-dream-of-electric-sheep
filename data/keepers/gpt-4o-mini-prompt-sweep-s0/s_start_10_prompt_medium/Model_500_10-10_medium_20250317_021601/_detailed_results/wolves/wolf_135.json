            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 92, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to prevent over-depletion of the sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help us balance our hunting with competition among wolves, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
