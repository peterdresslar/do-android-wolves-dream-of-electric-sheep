            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 7.04, it is essential to focus on maintaining a balance that allows for both wolf and sheep populations to thrive. A moderate theta of 0.3 will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing sheep to recover while also ensuring that the wolf population does not decline too rapidly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for healthy reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate approach will help prevent over-depletion of sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while allowing the sheep to regain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep aggressively. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
