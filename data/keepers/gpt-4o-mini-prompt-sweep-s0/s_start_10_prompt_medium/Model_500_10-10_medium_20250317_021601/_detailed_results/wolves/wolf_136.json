            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent depletion of the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
