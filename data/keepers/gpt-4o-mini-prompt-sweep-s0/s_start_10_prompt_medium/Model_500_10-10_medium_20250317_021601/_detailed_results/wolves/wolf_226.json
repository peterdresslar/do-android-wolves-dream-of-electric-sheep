            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance for the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the current sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete it too quickly. A theta of 0.55 allows for a moderate approach that supports both reproduction and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help balance hunting with the need for sheep to increase their numbers, avoiding overexploitation while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the wolves",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual approach will help maintain balance without causing sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid sudden declines in sheep, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep."
