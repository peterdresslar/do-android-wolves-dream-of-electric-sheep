            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover in the long term. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. It allows for gradual adjustments in response to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my theta to 0.55, I can intensify hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sheep recovery. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population."
