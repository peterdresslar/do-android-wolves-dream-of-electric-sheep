            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.204. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while also competing with other wolves. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach that balances the need to hunt with the necessity of maintaining sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 4.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 4.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.95, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.80, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.73, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate increase will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious approach to balance our needs with the ecosystem"
