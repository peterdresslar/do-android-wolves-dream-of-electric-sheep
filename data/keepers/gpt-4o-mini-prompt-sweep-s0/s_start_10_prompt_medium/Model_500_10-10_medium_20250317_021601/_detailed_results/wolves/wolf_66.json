            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.36, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a depletion of sheep. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment helps avoid overexploitation of the sheep and fosters a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help stabilize both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves at this lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within the wolf pack. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions and avoiding sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and recover."
