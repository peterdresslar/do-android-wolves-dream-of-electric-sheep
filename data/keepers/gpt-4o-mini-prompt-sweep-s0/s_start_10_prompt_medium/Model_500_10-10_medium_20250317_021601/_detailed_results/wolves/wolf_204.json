        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, my previous theta was very low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.25 allows for a cautious increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity at this stage could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to bounce back, which is essential for long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a collapse."
