            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking a severe depletion of their numbers. However, with the wolf population at 19, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still enabling our pack to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.77, it suggests that while there are enough sheep to sustain some hunting, I should be cautious not to overhunt. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta of 0.450 was a balanced approach, I believe a slight reduction to 0.40 will allow for a more cautious strategy that focuses on competition with other wolves while still permitting some hunting. This will help ensure the sheep can recover and maintain a sustainable population, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
