            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance our needs without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while preventing overhunting. This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can begin to support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting.
