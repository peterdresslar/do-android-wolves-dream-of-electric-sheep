            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a balance, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the current sheep availability without depleting their numbers too quickly. This moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a moderate approach is necessary. This theta value will help balance our hunting needs with the sustainability of the sheep population, preventing overexploitation and ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring our own population stabilizes. This gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was quite low at 0.200. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity, I will gradually increase my theta to 0.25. This approach balances the need for wolf survival with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species, as it focuses on competition among wolves rather than depleting the already scarce sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a severe depletion of sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
