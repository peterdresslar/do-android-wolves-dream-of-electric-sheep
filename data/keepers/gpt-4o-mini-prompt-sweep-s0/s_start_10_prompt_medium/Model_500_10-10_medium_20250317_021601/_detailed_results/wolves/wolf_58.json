            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to rebound while still enabling some reproduction among the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment to 0.30 aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.06, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.29, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves."
