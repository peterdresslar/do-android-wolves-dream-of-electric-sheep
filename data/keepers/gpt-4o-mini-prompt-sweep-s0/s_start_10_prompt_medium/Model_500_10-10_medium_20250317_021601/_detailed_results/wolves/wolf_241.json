            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance and avoid overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.600 allowed for some hunting, it is important to focus on a more balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover. A theta of 0.45 allows for moderate hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations as the wolf numbers are relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.27, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to stabilize. A gradual approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both."
