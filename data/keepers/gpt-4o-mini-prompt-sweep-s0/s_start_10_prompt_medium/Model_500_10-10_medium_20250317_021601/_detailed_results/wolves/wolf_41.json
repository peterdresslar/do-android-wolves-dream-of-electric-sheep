            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 155.18, which allows for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing, and a more moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 134.80, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant at 58.00. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between ensuring enough food for the pack while allowing the sheep population to remain sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 78, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can hunt, we should do so moderately to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 98. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.13. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach that balances the need for competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting long-term sustainability."
