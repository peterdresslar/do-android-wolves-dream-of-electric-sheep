            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, given the relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a depletion of sheep. A moderate decrease from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for balance and long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate decrease from my previous theta allows for continued reproduction while ensuring that the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to increase in numbers, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
