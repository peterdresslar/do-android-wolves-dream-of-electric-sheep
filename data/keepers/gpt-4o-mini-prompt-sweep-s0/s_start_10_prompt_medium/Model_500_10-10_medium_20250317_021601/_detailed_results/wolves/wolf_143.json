            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and my previous low theta indicates a focus on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance and prevents overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and I want to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure long-term sustainability and prevents over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to regenerate while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further, allowing for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
