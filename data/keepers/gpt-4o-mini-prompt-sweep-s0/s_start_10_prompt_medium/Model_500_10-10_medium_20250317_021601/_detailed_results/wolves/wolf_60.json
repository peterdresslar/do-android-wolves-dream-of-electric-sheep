            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence, giving sheep a chance to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach balances the need for food with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while ensuring our own numbers do not decline too rapidly. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.36, which is only 3.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.12. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem."
