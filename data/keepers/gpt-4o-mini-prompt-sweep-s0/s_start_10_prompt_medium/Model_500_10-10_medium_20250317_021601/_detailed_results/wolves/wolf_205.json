            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.3 strikes a balance between ensuring the wolves can thrive without overhunting the sheep, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help maintain the balance while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and hunting them aggressively could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help reduce pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to rebound while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize."
