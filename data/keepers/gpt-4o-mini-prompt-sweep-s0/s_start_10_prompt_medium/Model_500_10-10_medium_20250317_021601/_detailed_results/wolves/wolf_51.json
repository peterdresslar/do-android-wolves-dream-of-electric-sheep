            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment reflects my awareness of the need to balance hunting with competition among wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still supporting our own growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 78, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 10.06, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery of the sheep. However, with a wolf population of 77, I need to ensure that we maintain our numbers without over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.36, which is only 3.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population."
