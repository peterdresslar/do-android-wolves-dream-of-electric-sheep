            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can sustain themselves while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.73, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 119, I can afford to increase my theta slightly to 0.35 to ensure that wolves can still reproduce while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. Gradually reducing hunting intensity is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By focusing on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring both populations can stabilize over time."
