            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 4.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 4.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.95, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves."
