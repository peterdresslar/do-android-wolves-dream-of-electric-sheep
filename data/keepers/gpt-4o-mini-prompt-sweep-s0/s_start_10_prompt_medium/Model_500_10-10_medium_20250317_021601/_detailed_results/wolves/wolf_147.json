            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A gradual adjustment to 0.65 reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is important to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, helping to stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem."
