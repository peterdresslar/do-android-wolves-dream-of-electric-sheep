            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 83% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.77, it is essential to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for healthy reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 136, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves and support the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
