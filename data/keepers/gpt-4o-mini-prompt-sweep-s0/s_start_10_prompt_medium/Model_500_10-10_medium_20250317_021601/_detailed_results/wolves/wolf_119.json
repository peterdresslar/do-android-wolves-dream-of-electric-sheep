            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 82.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively small wolf population of 7, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment helps ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.55 will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is not yet at maximum capacity. Gradually increasing theta allows for adaptation to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.77, it indicates that while there are enough sheep to sustain some hunting, I must also be cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back."
