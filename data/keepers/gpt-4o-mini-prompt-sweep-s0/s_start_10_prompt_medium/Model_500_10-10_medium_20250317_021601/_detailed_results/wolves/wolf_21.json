            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overhunted. A gradual adjustment towards higher hunting will support reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.06, it is essential to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction in hunting intensity from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack can thrive without overexploiting the sheep. It reflects a cautious strategy that adapts to the current conditions and promotes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 78, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to maintain a healthy balance. A slight increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 98.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without causing sudden changes."
