            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 162, focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the need for balance, considering the current low sheep-to-wolf ratio and the importance of avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase in numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.27, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while preventing overexploitation of the remaining sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my focus should be on allowing them to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase in numbers while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without intense competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 indicates a focus on competition rather than hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the ecosystem."
