            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to adapt to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 136, a moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.08. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity, it could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by promoting a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
