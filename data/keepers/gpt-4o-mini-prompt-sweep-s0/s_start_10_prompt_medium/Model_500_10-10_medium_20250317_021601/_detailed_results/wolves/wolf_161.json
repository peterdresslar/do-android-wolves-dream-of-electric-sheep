            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.04. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while allowing the sheep to regain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
