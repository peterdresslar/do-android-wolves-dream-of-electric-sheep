            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.73, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.200 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on competition with other wolves, a small increase to 0.25 will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on competition rather than hunting.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey.
