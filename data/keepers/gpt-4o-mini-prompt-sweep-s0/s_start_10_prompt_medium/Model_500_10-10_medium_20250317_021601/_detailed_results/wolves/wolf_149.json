            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 136, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still providing some sustenance for the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the immediate needs of hunting with the long-term goal of sustainable coexistence."
