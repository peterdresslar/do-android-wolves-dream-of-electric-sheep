            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With only 2 wolves in the pack, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 70.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with only 3 wolves, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach balances our needs and the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious response to the growing wolf numbers, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance as the wolf population is low, and it allows for gradual recovery of both populations. A moderate approach will ensure long-term survival and prevent over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 32, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population, which is not yet at maximum capacity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 92, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes."
