            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough to support the wolf population while also allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while not over-depleting the sheep, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual balance as we monitor both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.06, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.36, which is only 3.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
