            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still recovering. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring sustainable sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population growth. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance between both populations."
