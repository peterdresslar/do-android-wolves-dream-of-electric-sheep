            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.00, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while maintaining a stable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 4.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 4.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both sheep recovery and wolf population health."
