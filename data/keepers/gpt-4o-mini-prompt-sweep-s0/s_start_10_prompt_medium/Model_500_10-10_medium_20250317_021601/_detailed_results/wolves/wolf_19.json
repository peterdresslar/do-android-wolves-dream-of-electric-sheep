            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and sustain itself. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with 18 wolves in the pack, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 9.14, suggesting that we can afford to hunt moderately without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.65 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.06, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need to sustain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but it's important to avoid overhunting. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment reflects the need to balance the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current trends and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate approach allows for gradual adjustments while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively without depleting the sheep too quickly, thus maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 6.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations."
