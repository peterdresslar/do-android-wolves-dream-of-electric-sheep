            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 76.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This value reflects a cautious strategy, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 11, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase is wise to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem as I adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a sudden decline in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
