            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This small increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain my wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance hunting with the need for sheep population recovery, while still being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a focus on allowing their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while also reducing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and the long-term health of our wolf pack. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance."
