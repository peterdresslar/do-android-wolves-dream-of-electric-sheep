            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.00, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase helps maintain balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 4.5% of its maximum capacity. Given the sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.40, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.95, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.80, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.73, which is only 5.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to support wolf reproduction. However, I must avoid overhunting to allow the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the current state and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.87, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
