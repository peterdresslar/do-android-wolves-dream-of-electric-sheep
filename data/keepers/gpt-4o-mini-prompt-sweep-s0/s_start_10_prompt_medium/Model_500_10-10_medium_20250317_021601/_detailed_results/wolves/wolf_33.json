However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.06, it is important to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still supporting the wolf population",

This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta value of 0.35 will help maintain a balance that supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",

This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover.
