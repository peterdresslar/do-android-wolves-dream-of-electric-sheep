            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that we do not overhunt the sheep, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual approach is essential to adapt to the current conditions without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, preventing over-exploitation and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
