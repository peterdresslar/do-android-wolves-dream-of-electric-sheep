            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A balanced approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting, a gradual increase to 0.55 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98.00, it is wise to avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. While the wolf population is relatively high, I want to avoid overexploitation of the sheep, so a slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without risking a crash in the sheep population."
