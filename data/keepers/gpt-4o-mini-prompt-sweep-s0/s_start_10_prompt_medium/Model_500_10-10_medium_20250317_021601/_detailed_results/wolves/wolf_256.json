            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still being cautious about the overall ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring that our wolf population does not deplete too quickly. A gradual approach is necessary to maintain balance and avoid a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.11, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity, it could lead to their further decline and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves at a lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.300 was already focused on competition with other wolves. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will reduce my hunting intensity slightly while still keeping an eye on the wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover.
