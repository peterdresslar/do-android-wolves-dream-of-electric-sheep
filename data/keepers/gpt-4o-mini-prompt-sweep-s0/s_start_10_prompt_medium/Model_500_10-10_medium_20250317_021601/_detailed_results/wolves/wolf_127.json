            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep and to promote a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.77, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance. This allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the hunting cycle. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our population, but it also prioritizes the recovery of the sheep, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
