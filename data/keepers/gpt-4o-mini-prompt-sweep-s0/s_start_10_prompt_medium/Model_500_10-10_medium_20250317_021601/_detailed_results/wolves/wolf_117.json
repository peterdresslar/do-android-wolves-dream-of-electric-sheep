            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 76.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a low wolf population of only 5, I need to focus on competing with other wolves to ensure our survival. A theta of 0.25 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the stability of both populations, promoting a gradual recovery of the wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep and to promote a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help ensure that both the sheep and wolf populations can stabilize and thrive. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations, allowing for healthy reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
