            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 63.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta of 0.18 suggests a focus on competition with other wolves. To ensure sustainable coexistence, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.30, allowing for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 3.88, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This moderate adjustment allows for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the need to adapt to both the current sheep population and the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and remain sustainable. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.9% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help maintain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash."
