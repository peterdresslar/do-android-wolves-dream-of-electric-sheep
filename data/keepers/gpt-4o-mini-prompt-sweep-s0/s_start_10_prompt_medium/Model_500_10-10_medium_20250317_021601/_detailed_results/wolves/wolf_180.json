            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 92, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves to ensure our long-term survival. A theta of 0.25 allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while prioritizing the stability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.73, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
