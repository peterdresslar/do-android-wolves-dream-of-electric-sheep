            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 136, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively low at 0.69, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to ensure our survival while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to bounce back, while also preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This approach will help prevent the depletion of the sheep population and support long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. A slight increase will allow for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance."
