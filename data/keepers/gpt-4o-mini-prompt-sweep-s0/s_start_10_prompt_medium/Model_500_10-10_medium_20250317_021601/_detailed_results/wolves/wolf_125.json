            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and my previous theta was quite low. A moderate increase to 0.3 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance, ensuring the sheep can recover while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 32, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate approach is necessary to prevent overhunting and ensure both populations can thrive. This theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers without depleting their population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population."
