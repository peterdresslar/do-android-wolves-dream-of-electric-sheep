            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to take advantage of the current sheep availability. However, I must be cautious and avoid drastic changes, so a moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, I can afford to slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still ensuring enough food for the wolves. This moderate approach will help sustain both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will allow for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By increasing theta slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population a chance to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting, which will help balance the ecosystem over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population some time to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance."
