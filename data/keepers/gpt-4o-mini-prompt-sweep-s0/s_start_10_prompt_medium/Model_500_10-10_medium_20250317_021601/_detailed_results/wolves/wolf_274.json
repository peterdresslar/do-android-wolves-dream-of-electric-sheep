By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.27, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still keeping an eye on potential hunting opportunities as the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.27, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.46, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity.

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to maintain hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery. This helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
