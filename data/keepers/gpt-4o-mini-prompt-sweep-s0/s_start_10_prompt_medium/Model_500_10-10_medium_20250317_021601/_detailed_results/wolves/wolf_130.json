            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A gradual adjustment is important to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. Gradually reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta will also account for the growing wolf population, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a moderate approach is necessary. A theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the increasing wolf population, which requires a gradual reduction in hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further."
