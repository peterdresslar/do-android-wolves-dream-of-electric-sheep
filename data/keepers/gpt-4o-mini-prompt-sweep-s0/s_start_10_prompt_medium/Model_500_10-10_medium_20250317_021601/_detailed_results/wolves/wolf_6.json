        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This value balances the need for wolves to reproduce while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.58, which is only 4.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.22, which is only 4.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.95, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.80, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.73, which is only 5.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing overexploitation while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.87, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.14, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.56, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population growth."
