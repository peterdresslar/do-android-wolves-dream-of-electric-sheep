            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 92, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.04. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.73, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both populations. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
