            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A theta of 0.5 reflects a cautious approach that supports both reproduction among wolves and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help balance hunting with the need for sheep to repopulate, preventing overexploitation while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, which is essential for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between my needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
