            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.77, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure, giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own population health. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
