            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 98, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. While there is a need to hunt to support the wolf population, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 106, I need to be cautious to avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.15, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.67, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.06, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that encourages coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of responding to population trends without causing sudden shifts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.36, which is only 3.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem while still keeping an eye on the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance that supports both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.98, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.70, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that increasing hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in the sheep population, which would jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
