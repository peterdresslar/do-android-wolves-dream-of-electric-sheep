            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 83.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.77, it is essential to focus on competition with other wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach balances the needs of both species and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 136, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sheep recovery, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to replenish while still enabling my pack to compete effectively with other wolves. Gradually adjusting to a more moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further."
