        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 37.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.720 indicated a strong hunting approach, I need to moderate my intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing for sustainable coexistence, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for recovery, and by focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to adapt to the current conditions without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity further, allowing the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a collapse."
