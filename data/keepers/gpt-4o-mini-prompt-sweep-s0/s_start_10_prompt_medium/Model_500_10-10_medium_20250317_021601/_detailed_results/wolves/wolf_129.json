            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking a significant depletion of their numbers. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still being mindful of the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 90.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to avoid overhunting as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate adjustment helps maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 83% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.77, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm the wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 37.6% of maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain moderate hunting intensity to ensure both wolf and sheep populations remain healthy. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A gradual adjustment to a lower theta will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
