            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 93.88, which is only 37.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By increasing my theta slightly to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population over immediate hunting intensity. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
