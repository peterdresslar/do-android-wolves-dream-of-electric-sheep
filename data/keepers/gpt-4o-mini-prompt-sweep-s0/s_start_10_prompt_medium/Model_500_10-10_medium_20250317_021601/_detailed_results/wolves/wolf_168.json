            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A theta of 0.6 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 65% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.03, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.73, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize."
