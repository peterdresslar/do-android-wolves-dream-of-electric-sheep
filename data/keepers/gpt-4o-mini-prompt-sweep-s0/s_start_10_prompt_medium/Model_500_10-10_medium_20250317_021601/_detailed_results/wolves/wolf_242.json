            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.69, it is prudent to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.51, which is only 13.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 11.97, which is only 4.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for wolf reproduction while still being cautious about depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being extremely low, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
