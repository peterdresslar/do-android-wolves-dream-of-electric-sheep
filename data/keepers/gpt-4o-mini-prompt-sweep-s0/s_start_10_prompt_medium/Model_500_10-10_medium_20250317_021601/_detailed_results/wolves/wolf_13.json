            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Gradual changes are key to avoiding drastic impacts on either species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight increase in hunting will not overly deplete the sheep, allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my theta to 0.55, I can intensify my hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to balance hunting with competition among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.15, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a lower theta value will help balance the ecosystem. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.52, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive, I must do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still supporting wolf reproduction."
