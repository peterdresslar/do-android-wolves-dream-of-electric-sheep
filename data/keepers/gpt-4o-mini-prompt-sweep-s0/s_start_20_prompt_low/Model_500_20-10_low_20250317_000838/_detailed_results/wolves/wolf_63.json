By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while reducing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt effectively without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
