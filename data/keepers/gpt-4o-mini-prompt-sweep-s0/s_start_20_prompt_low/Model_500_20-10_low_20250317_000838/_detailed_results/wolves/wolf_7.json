This approach allows me to remain competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This way, I can avoid overexertion and ensure I have enough strength for future hunts, especially since the competition among wolves is still present.",

By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. Hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves and a potential overexploitation of the sheep population. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the hunt without risking too much competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy balances my need for food with the current scarcity and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself."
