By lowering my intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion. This strategy balances my need for food with the increased competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.40, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy conservation and the need to secure food. This way, I can still compete with other wolves while being mindful of the overall prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, while still being competitive with other wolves.",
