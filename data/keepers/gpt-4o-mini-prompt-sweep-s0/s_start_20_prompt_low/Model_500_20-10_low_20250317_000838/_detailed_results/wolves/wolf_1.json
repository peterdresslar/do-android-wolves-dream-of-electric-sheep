            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep remains stable, and with 10 wolves competing for the same resource, a slightly lower intensity can help conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This strategy balances the need for survival with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, a slightly lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also competing for the same resources."
