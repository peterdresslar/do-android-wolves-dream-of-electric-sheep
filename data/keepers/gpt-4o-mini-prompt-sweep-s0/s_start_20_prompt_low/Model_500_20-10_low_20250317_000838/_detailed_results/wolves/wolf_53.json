A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, as the competition among wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity can be moderated to ensure sustainability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food while also avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without risking depletion of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the decreasing wolf population and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
