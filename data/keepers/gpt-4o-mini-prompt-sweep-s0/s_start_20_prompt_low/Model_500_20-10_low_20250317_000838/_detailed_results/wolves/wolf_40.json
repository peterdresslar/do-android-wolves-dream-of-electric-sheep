By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with other wolves not increasing in number, I can afford to hunt with a bit more intensity without overexploiting the resource. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 20 wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while also conserving energy. A slightly higher intensity than before will help me take advantage of the current sheep numbers without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. A lower intensity allows me to remain agile and ready for future opportunities while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to be cautious and not overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable. A balance is necessary to ensure I can hunt effectively without exhausting my energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer.
