A theta of 0.55 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising.

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be efficient while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
