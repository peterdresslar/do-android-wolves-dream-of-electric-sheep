            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the sheep population provides a good opportunity for hunting, and by raising my intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of this while still being cautious. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can secure food without overexerting myself or risking competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be moderated to avoid overexertion and ensure I have enough energy for future hunts. With the wolf population increasing, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt without competing too aggressively with others.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is increasing. A lower hunting intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food to sustain a moderate hunting intensity. By choosing a theta of 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the stable number of wolves. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself and competing against other wolves. This approach allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexertion and potential failure in catching prey. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still being proactive in securing my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success without overexerting myself.",
