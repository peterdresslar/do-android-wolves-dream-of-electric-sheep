            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition remains high with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival as I navigate the challenges posed by both the prey and my fellow wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.70, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competing with other wolves, who are likely hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With 20 wolves competing for the remaining 30.19 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation and potential starvation. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.
