            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself. By raising my intensity slightly from my previous 0.30, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself.",
