            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is still high, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 15 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for sustenance while minimizing the risk of overexertion and attracting attention from other wolves. This approach increases my chances of survival without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging situation.",
