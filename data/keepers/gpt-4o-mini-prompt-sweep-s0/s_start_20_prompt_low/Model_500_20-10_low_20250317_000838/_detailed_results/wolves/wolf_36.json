            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with 44.97 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while ensuring I have enough energy to evade potential threats.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the same prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to intensify.
