            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.45 to 0.55, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. With the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy balances the need to hunt with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the rising number of wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer.
