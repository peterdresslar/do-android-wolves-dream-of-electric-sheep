            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. With the number of wolves remaining constant, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt efficiently while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting.

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current sheep population at 25.85 and a stable wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for a successful hunt. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without exhausting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt efficiently while being mindful of the changing dynamics among the wolves.",
