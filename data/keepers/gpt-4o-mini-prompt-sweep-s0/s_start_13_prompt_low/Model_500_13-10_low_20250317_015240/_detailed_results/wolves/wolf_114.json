A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting may be less successful at maximum intensity. By adjusting to a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself in a scarce environment.",

By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline.
