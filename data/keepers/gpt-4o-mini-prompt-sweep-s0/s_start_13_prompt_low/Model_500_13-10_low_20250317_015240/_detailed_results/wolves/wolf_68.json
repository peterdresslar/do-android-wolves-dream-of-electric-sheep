By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
