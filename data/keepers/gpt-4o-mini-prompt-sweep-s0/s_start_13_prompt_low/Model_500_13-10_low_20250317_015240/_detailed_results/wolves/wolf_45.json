            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.25 to 0.35, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as I still need to be cautious about the dwindling prey and competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to overexertion without sufficient reward. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as the overall population of wolves is declining. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, indicating a competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.60 balances the need to secure food with the awareness of the changing dynamics in the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with fewer prey available, it may be wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower hunting intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the dwindling wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
