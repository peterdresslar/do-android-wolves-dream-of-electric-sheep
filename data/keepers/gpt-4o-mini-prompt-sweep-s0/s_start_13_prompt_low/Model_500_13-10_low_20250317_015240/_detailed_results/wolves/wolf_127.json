            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 18 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the wolf population is increasing and competition will be fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I want to balance this with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves, who may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to increase my chances of a successful hunt while being mindful of the competition from other wolves. A higher intensity will help me secure food, but I don",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, hunting at full intensity may not be necessary. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the competition with other wolves remains constant. This strategy balances the need to secure food while ensuring my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival.",

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the number of wolves remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to catch prey if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary and could lead to competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion while still being effective. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the declining wolf population, increasing my chances of survival."
