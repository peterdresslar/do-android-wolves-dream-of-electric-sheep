            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This allows me to take advantage of the growing food source while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with the current number of sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without pushing myself to the limit.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is rising with their increased numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current number of wolves remaining constant.",
