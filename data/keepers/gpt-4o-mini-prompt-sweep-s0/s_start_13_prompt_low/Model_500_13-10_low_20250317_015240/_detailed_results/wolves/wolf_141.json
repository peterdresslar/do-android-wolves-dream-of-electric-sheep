This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. However, since the number of wolves remains the same, I want to be cautious and not overexert myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being ready to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
