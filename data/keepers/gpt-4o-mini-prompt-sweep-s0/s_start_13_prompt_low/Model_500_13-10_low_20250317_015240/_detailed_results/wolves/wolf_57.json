            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the growing wolf population and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, as the sheep population is relatively stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 53.72 sheep and 18 wolves, the competition for food is significant. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population means competition is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey while avoiding overexertion and conflict with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the increase in wolves suggests competition is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure food while still conserving energy for future hunts, balancing the need for survival with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion.

A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy helps ensure my survival by not overexerting myself when prey is limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who may also be struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, indicating a competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves. This strategy may help me survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for successful hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to vulnerability. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a potentially dangerous environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking failure. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to be competitive while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
