            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is stable, and with 10 wolves competing for the same prey, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid drawing too much attention to myself and reduce the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability, but the number of wolves has remained the same. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can take advantage of the increased sheep without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to be more cautious and still secure enough food for survival. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the risk of competition with other wolves while ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in wolves, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to be more aggressive while still being cautious, ensuring my survival and maximizing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, I can afford to hunt with slightly less intensity. This allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. A lower theta also reduces competition with other wolves, as they will likely hunt at maximum intensity."
