            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, making hunting at maximum intensity risky. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in sheep numbers, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy. This way, I can still compete with other wolves without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt efficiently while being mindful of the risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting, but the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still allowing for opportunistic hunting if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the number of wolves decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival as I adapt to the changing dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because with 17.49 sheep and 6 wolves, the competition for food is still significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating a good food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with other wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey without overexerting myself.",

By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher availability of prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, it's important to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. The sheep population has increased slightly, so a moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting.
