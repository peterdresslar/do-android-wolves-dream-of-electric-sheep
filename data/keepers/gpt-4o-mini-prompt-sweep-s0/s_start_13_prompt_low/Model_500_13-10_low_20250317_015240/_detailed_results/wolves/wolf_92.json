            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. With more wolves in the area, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with others for the dwindling prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a tough environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the number of wolves remaining stable, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly. This will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
