            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to secure food while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 49.91 sheep available, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to take advantage of the abundance. However, I want to avoid overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion, especially since the number of wolves remains the same. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while still being cautious.",

With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to contribute to the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",

By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
