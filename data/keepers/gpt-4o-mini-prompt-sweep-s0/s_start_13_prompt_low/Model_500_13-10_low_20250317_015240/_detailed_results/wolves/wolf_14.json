            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. A slightly lower intensity allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey while avoiding direct confrontation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the pack's success while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, while the wolf population has increased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the wolf population, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's success. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be more aggressive.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food for myself while still being cautious, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, ensuring I have enough resources to survive without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey availability without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.
