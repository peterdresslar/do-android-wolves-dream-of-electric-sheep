By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population is rising. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing a meal, balancing the risk of overexertion with the need to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
