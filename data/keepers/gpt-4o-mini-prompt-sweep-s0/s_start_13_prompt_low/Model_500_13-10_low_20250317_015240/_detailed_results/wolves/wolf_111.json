This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more sustainable, allowing me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.30 balances the need to hunt effectively while minimizing risk.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still survive while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to contribute to the pack's success without risking my own well-being.",
