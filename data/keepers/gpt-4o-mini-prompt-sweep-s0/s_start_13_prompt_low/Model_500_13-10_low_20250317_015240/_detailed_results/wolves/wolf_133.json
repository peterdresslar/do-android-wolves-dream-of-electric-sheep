By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for myself while still being mindful of the competition."
