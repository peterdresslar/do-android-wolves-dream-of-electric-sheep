            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food if I hunt at maximum intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the declining trend of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
