            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for all. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting may be less successful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance the risk of overexerting myself with the need to secure food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without pushing myself to the limit, which could be dangerous given the recent decrease in the wolf population."
