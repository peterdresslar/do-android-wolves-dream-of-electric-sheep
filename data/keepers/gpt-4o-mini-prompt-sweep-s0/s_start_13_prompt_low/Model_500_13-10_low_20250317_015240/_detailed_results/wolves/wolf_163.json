            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less fruitful. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves remains unchanged. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population remains stable. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive situation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure my survival while not overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the decreasing trend of the wolf population, while still being effective in hunting."
