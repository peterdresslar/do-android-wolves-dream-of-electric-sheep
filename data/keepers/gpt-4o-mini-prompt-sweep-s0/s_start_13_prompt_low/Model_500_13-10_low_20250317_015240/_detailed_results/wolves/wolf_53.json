            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased, the number of wolves has also risen. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, leading to more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
