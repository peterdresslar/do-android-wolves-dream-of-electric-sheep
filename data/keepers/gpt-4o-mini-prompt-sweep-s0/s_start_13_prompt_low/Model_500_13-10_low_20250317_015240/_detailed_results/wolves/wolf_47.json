            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid overexertion, which could jeopardize my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my long-term survival.",

By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the plentiful sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment.
