            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity from 0.65 to 0.75, I can take advantage of this situation while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By raising my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still conserving energy compared to the maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant."
