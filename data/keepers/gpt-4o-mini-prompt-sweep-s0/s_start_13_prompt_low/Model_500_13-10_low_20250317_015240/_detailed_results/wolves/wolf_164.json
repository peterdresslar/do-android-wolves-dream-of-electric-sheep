            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the situation while still being able to hunt if necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, it's important to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the changing environment without risking depletion of resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the competition with other wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining constant, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. Increasing my theta slightly from 0.40 to 0.60 will help me secure enough food while still being cautious, considering the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has also declined. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises."
