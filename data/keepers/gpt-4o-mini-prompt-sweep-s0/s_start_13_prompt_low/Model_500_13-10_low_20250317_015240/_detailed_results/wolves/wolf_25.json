            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food for myself while still being cautious not to overexert and risk injury or depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the recent decrease in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition with other wolves remains high. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
