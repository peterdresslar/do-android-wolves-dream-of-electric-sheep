            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 21 wolves, competition for food is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. A moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means hunting might be less successful at maximum intensity. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough prey without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, considering the recent increase in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt more aggressively while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious about the dwindling prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With the number of wolves remaining the same, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious, as the wolf population has also decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both populations suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while ensuring my own longevity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I must be cautious not to overexert myself, as the trend shows a decrease in the wolf population, which indicates competition for resources."
