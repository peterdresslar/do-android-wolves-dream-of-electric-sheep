            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the number of wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and reduce my chances of securing a meal. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially with a decent number of sheep available.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests that competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. By increasing my theta from 0.50 to 0.65, I can take advantage of the rising sheep population while still being cautious about the increasing number of wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival while maximizing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in this growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is intensifying. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food for myself while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexerting myself and attracting attention from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without risking starvation.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of energy conservation. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high.
