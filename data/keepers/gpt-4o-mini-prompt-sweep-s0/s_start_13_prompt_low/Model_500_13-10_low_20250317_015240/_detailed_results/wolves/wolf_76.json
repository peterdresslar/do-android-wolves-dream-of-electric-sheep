            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is likely to be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves, the competition is significant. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, and the wolf population has increased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a more valuable resource. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a slightly higher intensity will help ensure I can secure enough food while still managing the risk of overexertion. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexertion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival without risking injury or exhaustion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while being mindful of the dwindling prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks given the declining prey and rival population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population indicates competition is tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the dwindling wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased.
