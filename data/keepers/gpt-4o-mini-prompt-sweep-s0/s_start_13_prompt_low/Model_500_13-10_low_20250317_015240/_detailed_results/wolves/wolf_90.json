            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while also conserving energy. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the rising wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the wolf population, and with more wolves around, competition for food will increase. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 17 wolves competing for food, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy may help me avoid overexertion and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains uncertain.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being active enough to hunt when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and risk. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food while being cautious about the dwindling wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival while conserving energy. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high.
