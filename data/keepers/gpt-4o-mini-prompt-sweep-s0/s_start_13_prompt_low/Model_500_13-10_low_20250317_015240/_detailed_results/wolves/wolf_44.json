            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need to survive with the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better ensure my survival while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion if the sheep population continues to decline.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for dwindling resources. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing.

This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my longevity.",

By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough food without overexerting myself or risking competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch prey while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
