            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a higher intensity will improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between maximizing my hunting efforts and conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my intensity to 0.60, I can still contribute to the hunt while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring my long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food without overexerting myself. Increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60 allows me to be more competitive with the other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation."
