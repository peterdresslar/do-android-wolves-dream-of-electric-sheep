            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to hunt more aggressively to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 balances the need for a stronger hunt while still considering the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
