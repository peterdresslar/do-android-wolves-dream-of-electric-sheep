This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing more opportunities for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves while still being mindful of the sheep population, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for the same prey.",
