            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. With the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition for limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the decreasing trend of the wolf population and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a challenging environment. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still participating in hunts when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a dwindling prey environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a lower availability of food. With fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion or failure if the sheep are scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, which has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for a successful hunt. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food while being cautious of the dwindling wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and with the recent decrease in wolves, hunting at a lower intensity may help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. By being strategic, I can still secure food while minimizing risk.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.
