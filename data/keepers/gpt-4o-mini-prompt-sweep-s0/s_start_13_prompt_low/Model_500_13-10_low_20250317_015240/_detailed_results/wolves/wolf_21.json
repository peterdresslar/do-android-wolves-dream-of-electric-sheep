By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",

A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation and still secure my survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
