However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself.

With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means competition for food is still present but slightly less intense.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and increasing my hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing food. With the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to be more competitive to ensure my survival, especially since other wolves will also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",

However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves.",

This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available sheep while still being cautious, as hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or attracting unwanted attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at full intensity might lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey, risking injury or exhaustion.
