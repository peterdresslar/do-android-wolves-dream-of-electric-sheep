By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while also conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the situation and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still conserving some energy in case the situation changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the pack while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.

This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",

This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta of 0.60, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
