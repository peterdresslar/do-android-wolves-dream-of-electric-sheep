With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's success. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to stay competitive without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves hasn't changed. This way, I can ensure my survival while still having a chance to catch prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive without risking exhaustion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 22 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
