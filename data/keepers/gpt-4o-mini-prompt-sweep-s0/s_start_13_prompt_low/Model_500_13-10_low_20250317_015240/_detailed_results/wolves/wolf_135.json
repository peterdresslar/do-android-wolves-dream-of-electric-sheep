By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself and risking injury or depletion of resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This approach allows me to avoid overexertion and increases my chances of survival in the long run, especially with the recent increase in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher.
