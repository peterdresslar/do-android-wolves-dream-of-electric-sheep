            "I chose this theta because increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75 allows me to be more competitive in securing food while still conserving some energy. With 10 wolves and only 13 sheep, the competition is fierce, and I need to balance between hunting effectively and not exhausting myself completely.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a slightly reduced hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid direct competition with other wolves and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure food without overexerting myself or risking injury. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more efficient in hunting while being mindful of the overall situation."
