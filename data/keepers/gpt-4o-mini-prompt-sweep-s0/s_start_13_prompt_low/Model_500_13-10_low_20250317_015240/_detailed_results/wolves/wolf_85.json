            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion and conflict with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy compared to the maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With the number of wolves remaining the same, a moderate intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially declining environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and attracting attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting too much attention from other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given that the wolf population has decreased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.50 allows me to hunt effectively without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a stable food source. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food.
