            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion in a potentially scarce food situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary and could lead to wasted energy. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tighter competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
