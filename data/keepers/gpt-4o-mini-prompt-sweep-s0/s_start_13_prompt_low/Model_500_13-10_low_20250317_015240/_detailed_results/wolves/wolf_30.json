With the wolf population increasing, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity increases my chances of securing food before others do. However, I don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with others for dwindling resources. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves competing for fewer sheep, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I don",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.60 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
