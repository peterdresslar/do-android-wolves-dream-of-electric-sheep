By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",

However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I have enough energy for future hunts. A slightly reduced intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the recent decrease in the wolf population, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to hunt more strategically and ensure my survival."
