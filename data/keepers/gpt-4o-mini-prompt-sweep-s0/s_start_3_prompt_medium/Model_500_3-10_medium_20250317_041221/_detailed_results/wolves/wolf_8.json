        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a scarcity of prey. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.19, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can rebound, thus promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.40, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.43, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also adapting to the current wolf population of 8.00, which is relatively high. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and promotes the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.92, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment aligns with the need for gradual changes and considers the current low sheep population while still being mindful of the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting while still focusing on the balance needed for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.95, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.37, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.83, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.35, which is only 2.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.93, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.56, which is only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack"
