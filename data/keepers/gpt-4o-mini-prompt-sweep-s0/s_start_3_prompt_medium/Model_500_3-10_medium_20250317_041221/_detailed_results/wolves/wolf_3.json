            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting the sheep further if we hunt too aggressively. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.19, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high relative to the sheep population, and the sheep are at a low percentage of their maximum capacity. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also addressing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment is small enough to avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem."
