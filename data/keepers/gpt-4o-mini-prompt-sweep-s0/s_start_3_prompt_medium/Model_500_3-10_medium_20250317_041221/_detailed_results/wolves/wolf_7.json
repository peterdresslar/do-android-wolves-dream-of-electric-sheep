            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.19, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 9.00, a slight increase in theta to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.40, which is only 1.4% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 8.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on maintaining my own population, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help me balance hunting with competition among wolves, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.92, which is only 1.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and I need to focus on allowing them to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 4.95, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep to ensure a sustainable food source for the future. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.37, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.83, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also helps to avoid overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring that the wolf population can thrive in the future."
