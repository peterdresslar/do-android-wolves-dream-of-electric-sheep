            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta value will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.19, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential strain on resources if hunting is too intense. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf health while giving sheep a chance to recover."
