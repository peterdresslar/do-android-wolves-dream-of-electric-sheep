            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.12. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it's crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is not enough food for the current wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting some recovery in the sheep population while still considering the need for wolves to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.54, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.67, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
