        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep and supports long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our own population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to adapt to the current conditions, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.7% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. Increasing theta too much could lead to further depletion of sheep, jeopardizing both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.82, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. Given the low sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.61, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 1.98, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a need for caution. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting approach while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 2.36, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, as the wolf population is also relatively low.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase their numbers while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize."
