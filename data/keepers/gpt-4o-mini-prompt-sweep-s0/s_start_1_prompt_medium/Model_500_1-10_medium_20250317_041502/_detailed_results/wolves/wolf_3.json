            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was too low to support sustainable hunting. By increasing theta slightly, I can begin to hunt more effectively while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too high for the current conditions. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing for some hunting, which is essential for maintaining our population without depleting the sheep further."
