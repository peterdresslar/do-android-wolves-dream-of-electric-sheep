            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help the wolf population thrive while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for a gradual increase in hunting as the sheep population stabilizes. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
