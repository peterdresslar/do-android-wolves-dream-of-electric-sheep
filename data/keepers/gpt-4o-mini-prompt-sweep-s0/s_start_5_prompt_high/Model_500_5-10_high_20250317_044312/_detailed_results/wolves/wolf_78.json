            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",

By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
