            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating a need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.8% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. Given the high wolf population, a moderate adjustment helps to manage competition among wolves and supports sustainable coexistence with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition within our pack. This approach promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. Lowering the hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
