However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling the wolf pack to sustain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
