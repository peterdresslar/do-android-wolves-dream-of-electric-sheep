            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is key to sustaining the balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.65 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 150.06, which allows for a moderate hunting intensity. This level of theta supports the wolf population's needs while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain a sustainable balance. It reflects a cautious approach to hunting, considering the current state of both populations and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can help the sheep population recover while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf reproduction. This moderate approach aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and with the sheep population at only 37% of its maximum capacity, it",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for reduced hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.
