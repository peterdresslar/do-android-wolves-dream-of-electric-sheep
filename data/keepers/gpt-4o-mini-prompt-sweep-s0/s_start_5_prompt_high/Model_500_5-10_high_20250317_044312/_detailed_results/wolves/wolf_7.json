            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population also relatively low, it is important to focus on competition among wolves to allow sheep to recover. This lower hunting intensity will help maintain balance and ensure long-term survival for both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that our wolf population does not grow too quickly. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep further.",
