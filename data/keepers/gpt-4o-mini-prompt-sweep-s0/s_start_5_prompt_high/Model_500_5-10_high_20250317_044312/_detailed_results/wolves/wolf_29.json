            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 150.06, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still considering the need for balance as the wolf numbers are moderately high.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still focusing on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aims to maintain a balance that prevents over-depletion of sheep and supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote long-term sustainability.",
