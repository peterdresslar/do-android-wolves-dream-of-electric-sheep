            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to stabilize while we manage our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, given the high wolf population and the unfavorable sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate approach is necessary to ensure sustainable coexistence and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This will allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we adapt to the current conditions. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual approach will help prevent a crash in both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution.
