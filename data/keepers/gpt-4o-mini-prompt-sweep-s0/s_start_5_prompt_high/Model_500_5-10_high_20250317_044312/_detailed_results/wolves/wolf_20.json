            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 150.06, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A moderate approach balances our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, a moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment will help prevent overexploitation of sheep and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep population to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain a balance that supports both the wolf and sheep populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
