            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing for some sheep recovery, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, suggesting that I should be cautious about over-hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is high, which suggests that competition is also a concern. A moderate theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics. This cautious approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing pressure on the wolf population, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating that increased competition among wolves could be more beneficial than intense hunting of sheep at this time. This lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
