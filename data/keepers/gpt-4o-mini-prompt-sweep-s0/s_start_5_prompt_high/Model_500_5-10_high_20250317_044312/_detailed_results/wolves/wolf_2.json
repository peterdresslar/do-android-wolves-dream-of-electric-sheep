With the wolf population also relatively low, focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our numbers. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need to maintain a sustainable balance."
