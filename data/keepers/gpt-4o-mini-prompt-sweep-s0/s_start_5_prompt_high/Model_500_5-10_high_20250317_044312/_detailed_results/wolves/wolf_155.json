            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a balanced approach is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach will allow for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain stability. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. A theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help the sheep recover while preventing overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow us to focus on competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow the sheep to regain their numbers while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate approach allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and ensures a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 27.4% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
