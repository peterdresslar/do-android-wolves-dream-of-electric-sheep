            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support the growth of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the growth of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 150.57, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio of 10.75 suggests that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 150.06, which is 60.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. A moderate increase to 0.60 reflects a cautious approach to ensure that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This balance will help prevent over-depletion of sheep while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our own population. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being quite high, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
