However, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance as conditions evolve.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance immediate hunting needs with long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population moderately high, maintaining a theta around 0.50 helps ensure that we can continue to coexist with the sheep while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment allows for the possibility of future increases in hunting intensity if the sheep population continues to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This approach balances the need for food with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure long-term sustainability.",

This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
