This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to population trends without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 35.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive together while also considering the gradual increase in sheep numbers.",

A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

This adjustment will help maintain the balance as the wolf population is moderately high, while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase will support our long-term survival and allow for a healthier ecosystem.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our own population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without causing sudden shifts.",

This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
