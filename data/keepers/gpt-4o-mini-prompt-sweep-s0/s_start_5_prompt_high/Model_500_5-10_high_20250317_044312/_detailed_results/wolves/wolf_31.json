            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is reasonably plentiful at 150.06, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.52, a moderate increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still permitting some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering the hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still allowing for some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
