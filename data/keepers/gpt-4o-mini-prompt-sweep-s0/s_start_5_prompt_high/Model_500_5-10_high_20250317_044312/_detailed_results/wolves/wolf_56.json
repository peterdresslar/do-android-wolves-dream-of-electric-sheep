This adjustment aims to maintain a balance that supports both the wolf and sheep populations without risking depletion.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on the wolf population, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.
