            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a potential crash in the ecosystem.",

A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
