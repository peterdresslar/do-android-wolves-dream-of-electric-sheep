A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf pack remains stable. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and ensures long-term survival for both species.",

This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
