            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. A theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting of sheep. This will help maintain the sheep population and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 33.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being moderately high and the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, a gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This theta allows for a cautious approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
