However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.89, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species.

A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers the moderately high wolf population and the need for coexistence.",
