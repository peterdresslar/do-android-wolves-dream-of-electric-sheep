            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is gradual, reflecting the need to balance both populations without causing drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By focusing on reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves.
