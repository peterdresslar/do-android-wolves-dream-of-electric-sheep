            "I chose this theta because, with 10 wolves and only 1 sheep, the competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population and the slight increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting efforts. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, especially since other wolves may also be competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with fewer wolves around, I need to balance my intensity to ensure I can still catch prey without exhausting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be effective while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt with lower intensity while still securing enough resources for survival. A lower theta also conserves energy for future hunts."
