            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the overall population of wolves has decreased. This suggests that competition for food may be less intense, allowing me to hunt with a bit less intensity while still being effective. A theta of 0.75 balances the need to secure food without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. The increase in sheep suggests that there are opportunities for food, but I need to be cautious and not overexert myself, especially since other wolves may also be competing for the same prey.",
