            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 1 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition among the pack, risking injury or exhaustion. By reducing my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and avoiding conflict with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a fluctuating environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially since the sheep population has increased slightly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still ensuring I can secure enough food. A lower theta also conserves energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while not overexerting myself, as other wolves may still be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the number of wolves has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This balance allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt, ensuring my survival in this competitive environment."
