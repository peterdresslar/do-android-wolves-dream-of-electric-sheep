            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 1 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition among us, risking injury or exhaustion. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid conflict while still contributing to the hunt if necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the number of wolves has decreased. This suggests that there may be more opportunities for hunting without overwhelming competition. By increasing my intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the situation while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population is lower.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the number of wolves, it may be beneficial to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially since the sheep population has increased slightly. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival."
