            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 1 sheep, the competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in sheep suggests a good opportunity for hunting, while the decrease in wolves indicates less competition. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival and maximizing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population and the slight increase in sheep, I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased, indicating a more competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be more opportunities for hunting without overwhelming competition from other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy for future hunts."
