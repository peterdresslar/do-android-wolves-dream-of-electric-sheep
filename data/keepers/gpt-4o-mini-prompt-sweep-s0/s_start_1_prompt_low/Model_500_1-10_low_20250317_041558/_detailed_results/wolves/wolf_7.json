            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 1 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition among the pack, risking injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival and success without drawing too much attention.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with the remaining wolves while also conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be effective without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population and the slight increase in sheep, it\u2019s wise to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. A lower intensity allows me to remain agile and ready for future opportunities while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking injury. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased, which means competition for food is less intense. With fewer wolves, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity while still being able to catch enough sheep to survive. This approach conserves energy and reduces the risk of injury, allowing me to thrive in a more cautious manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be effective without risking too much in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I have a better chance of successfully hunting without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete effectively without exhausting myself or risking failure. A theta of 0.70 allows me to take advantage of the increased prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, but the number of wolves remains the same. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if needed. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment."
