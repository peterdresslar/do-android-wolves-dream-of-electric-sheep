            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking failure. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy may help me survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves.
