This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can avoid competition with other wolves and ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the wolf population remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I can still catch prey while conserving energy for future hunts.",

A moderate increase from my previous theta allows me to be more competitive without exhausting myself, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment.

This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
