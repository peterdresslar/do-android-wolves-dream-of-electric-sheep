            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the increased wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition for dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being competitive.",

This allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves has intensified. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall population of sheep is low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
