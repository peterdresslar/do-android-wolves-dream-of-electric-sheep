            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity may help me conserve energy while still allowing for a successful hunt. This cautious approach also reduces the risk of competition with other wolves, as they may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, and the number of wolves has decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased, indicating increased competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking too much in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete with others while conserving energy for future hunts. A theta of 0.50 allows me to be effective without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity while still ensuring I get enough food. This approach allows me to conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, which is crucial for my survival in the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Given the recent decrease in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can take advantage of the higher number of sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has also decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This way, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexertion."
