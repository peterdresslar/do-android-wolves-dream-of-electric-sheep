            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower intensity allows me to be strategic and wait for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of injury. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too fiercely with other wolves, while still maintaining a chance to catch prey. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without risking too much competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I aim to secure enough food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a dwindling population of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can survive without overexerting myself. With other wolves also hunting, a moderate intensity allows me to contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy may help me survive longer in a competitive environment where resources are scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the decreased wolf population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a higher intensity without risking overexertion. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the caution required in a changing environment."
