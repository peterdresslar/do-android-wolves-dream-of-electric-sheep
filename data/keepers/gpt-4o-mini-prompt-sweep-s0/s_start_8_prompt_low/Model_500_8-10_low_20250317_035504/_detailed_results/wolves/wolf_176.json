            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of this opportunity while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains the same. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting intensity should be moderated to avoid overexploitation. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without risking starvation."
