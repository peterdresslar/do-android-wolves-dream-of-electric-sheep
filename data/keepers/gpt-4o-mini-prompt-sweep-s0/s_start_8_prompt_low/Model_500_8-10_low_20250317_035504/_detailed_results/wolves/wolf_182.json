Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75 allows me to be more aggressive in securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I want to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. By reducing my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially since other wolves are also hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 11 wolves competing for food, a slightly increased hunting intensity will help me secure enough resources while still being cautious.

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food without overexerting myself. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the growing sheep population while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the higher prey availability while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
