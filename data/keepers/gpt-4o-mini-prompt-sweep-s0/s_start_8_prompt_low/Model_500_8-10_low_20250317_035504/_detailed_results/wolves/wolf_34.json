With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",

Additionally, with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population and a decrease in sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation while still contributing to the hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",

With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without risking too much competition with other wolves.",

This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
