By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between aggression and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating more potential food. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or risking failure.

A moderate intensity of 0.75 allows me to be efficient without risking exhaustion, especially since the other wolves are also competing for the same dwindling resources.",

By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions are more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 21 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure while still taking advantage of the available prey. This way, I can increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer.
