            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to be cautious and conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to balance the risk of competition with the need to secure food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased wolf population. A balance between aggression and caution is essential for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves remains high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy balances my need for survival with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is declining. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. With fewer sheep, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as the population of wolves is declining. This allows me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or danger from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
