            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt if necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources and avoid overexerting myself in a competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce resource situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, indicating that hunting may not be as fruitful as before. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be more opportunities for hunting without overwhelming competition from other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is less intense. With 12.89 sheep available, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity to conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself. This strategy allows me to survive while still contributing to the pack's needs without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the wolf population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion and ensure I have enough energy for future hunts. A moderate intensity allows me to contribute to the pack while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased, and the sheep population is relatively stable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a chance to hunt effectively without overexerting myself."
