This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves, I can afford to hunt with moderate intensity to ensure I can secure food while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
