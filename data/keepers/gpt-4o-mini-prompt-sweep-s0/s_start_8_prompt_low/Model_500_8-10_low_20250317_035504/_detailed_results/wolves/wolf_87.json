            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or attracting too much competition. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring I still have enough energy to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still survive while being cautious about the dwindling prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential starvation. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources."
