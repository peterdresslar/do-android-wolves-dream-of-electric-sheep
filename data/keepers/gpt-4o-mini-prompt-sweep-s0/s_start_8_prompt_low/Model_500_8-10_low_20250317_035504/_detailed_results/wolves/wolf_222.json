            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is rising. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.65 to 0.75, I can improve my chances of a successful hunt while still conserving energy for future needs. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By lowering my intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a fluctuating environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially since the number of wolves has remained constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
