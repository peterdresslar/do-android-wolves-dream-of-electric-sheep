            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself in a crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 21 wolves competing for food, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will improve my chances of securing a meal without overexerting myself. This balance allows me to be more efficient and increases my survival odds.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means hunting may become less rewarding. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from 0.60 to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of a successful hunt while still being mindful of the competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity from 0.45 to 0.55, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy compared to the maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition with other wolves remains high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the current number of wolves remaining stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains unchanged.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being cautious about the overall competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival."
