By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to be cautious and not overexert myself, as the wolf population remains stable. A theta of 0.75 balances the need for food with the risk of exhausting my energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful if I go all out. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can still be competitive without overexerting myself, allowing for a balance between energy conservation and the need to secure food.",
