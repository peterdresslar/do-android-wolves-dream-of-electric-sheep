            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around and fewer sheep, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A slightly reduced intensity allows for a more sustainable approach while still ensuring I have enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. However, I must balance this with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to a further decline in sheep and ultimately harm my chances in the long run.",
