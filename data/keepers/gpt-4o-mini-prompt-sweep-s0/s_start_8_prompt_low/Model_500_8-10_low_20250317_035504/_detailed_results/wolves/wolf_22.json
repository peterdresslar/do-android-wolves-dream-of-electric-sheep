            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food for myself while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the sheep population has decreased slightly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for dwindling resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it more challenging to find food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, as the competition among wolves is also rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
