            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 8 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure to secure food. By lowering my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. Since the wolf population has decreased, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food."
