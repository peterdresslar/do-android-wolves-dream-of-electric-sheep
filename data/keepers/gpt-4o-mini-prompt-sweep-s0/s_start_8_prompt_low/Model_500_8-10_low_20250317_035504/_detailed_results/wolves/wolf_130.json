            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity increases my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a potentially risky environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for fewer resources. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to secure food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased.
