            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population, while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, the competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, ensuring my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or danger from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still having a chance to catch food without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the overall wolf population is declining.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with others, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy may also reduce competition with other wolves, as they are likely to hunt at maximum intensity and may exhaust themselves."
