            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to be cautious and conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or overhunting. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a sustainable hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid overexertion, which could jeopardize my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the declining resources and avoid competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",

By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased.

This approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",

By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the current dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for a successful hunt. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense.

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is tough, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I don't exhaust myself or attract too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be effective while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. A lower theta will help conserve energy and ensure my survival in a potentially changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 21 sheep and 6 wolves, the prey-to-predator ratio is favorable.
