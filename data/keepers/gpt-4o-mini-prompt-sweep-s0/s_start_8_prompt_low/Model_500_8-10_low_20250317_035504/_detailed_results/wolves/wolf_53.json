            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. Additionally, the increase in wolves means more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the fluctuating prey availability and the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks with fewer sheep available.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a declining prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making it harder to find food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less productive. With more wolves competing for fewer sheep, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks. This way, I can still hunt effectively while ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in wolf population, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival. By not competing at maximum intensity, I can avoid direct confrontation with other wolves and still have a chance to hunt successfully when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing a meal. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment."
