This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance may help ensure my survival as the competition among wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the wolf population is also declining.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less fierce. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I have a better chance of successfully hunting without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting intensity can be moderated to ensure I still have enough energy for future hunts while not overexerting myself in a potentially competitive environment. A balanced approach will help me survive without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach.
