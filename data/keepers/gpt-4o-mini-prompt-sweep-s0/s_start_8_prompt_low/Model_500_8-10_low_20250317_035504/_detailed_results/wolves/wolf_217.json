However, with an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I still have enough food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for resources while still being mindful of energy conservation. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between hunting efficiently and not overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting too much attention while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 20 wolves, competition for food is present. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a stable but competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.50, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. A balance is needed to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing slightly and the number of wolves remaining stable, I need to balance my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be competitive without overexerting myself, ensuring I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting might be less rewarding. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive against other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less fruitful. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous 0.50, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
