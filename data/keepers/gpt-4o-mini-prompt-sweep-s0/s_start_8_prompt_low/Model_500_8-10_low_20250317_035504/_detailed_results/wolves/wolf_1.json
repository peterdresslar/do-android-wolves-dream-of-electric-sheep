            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at full intensity may not be necessary, as there are fewer competitors for the available prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the sheep population, ensuring my survival in a potentially competitive environment."
