            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better ensure my survival while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to diminishing returns if other wolves are also hunting aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a lower hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This approach balances the need for survival with the current scarcity of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall trend indicates a decline in wolves, which could mean more opportunities for survival if I hunt smartly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being mindful of the risks involved with higher competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with moderate intensity to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has remained stable. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",

This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 13 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still being effective. This approach balances the risk of overexertion with the need to secure enough food for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough resources without exhausting myself or overexerting in competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.65 allows me to be more aggressive than my previous choice while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",

This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population remaining stable, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because with 31.57 sheep and 11 wolves, the competition for food is moderate.
