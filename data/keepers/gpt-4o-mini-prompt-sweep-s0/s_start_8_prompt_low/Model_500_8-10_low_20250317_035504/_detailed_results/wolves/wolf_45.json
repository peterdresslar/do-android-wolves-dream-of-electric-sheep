            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decrease in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling prey and the increased competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to the recent decrease in their population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself while still being able to catch prey if the opportunity arises.",
