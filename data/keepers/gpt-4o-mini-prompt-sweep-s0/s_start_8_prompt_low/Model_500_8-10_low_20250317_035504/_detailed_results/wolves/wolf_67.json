With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without exhausting myself or risking failure. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to depletion of resources or attracting too much attention from other wolves. This moderate approach allows for sustainable hunting and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly.

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack while ensuring my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is less intense. With 12.89 sheep available, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity to conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself. This strategy allows me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense.
