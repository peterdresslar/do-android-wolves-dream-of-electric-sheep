By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with a stable number of wolves and an increase in sheep, I need to balance the risk of overexertion with the opportunity to secure food. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the increased sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining constant, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I still have enough energy for future hunts and avoid competition with other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to catch prey while conserving some energy.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's overall success.
