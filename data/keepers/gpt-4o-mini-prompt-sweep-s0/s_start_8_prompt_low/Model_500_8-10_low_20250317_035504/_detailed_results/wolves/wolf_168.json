By increasing my intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population is increasing.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive while also conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the wolf population, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better ensure my survival while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the available prey."
