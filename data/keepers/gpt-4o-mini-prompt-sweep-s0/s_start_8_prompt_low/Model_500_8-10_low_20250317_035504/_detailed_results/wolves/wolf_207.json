            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 19 wolves competing for food, a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased slightly, indicating a good opportunity for hunting. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while avoiding overexertion. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be competitive without risking depletion of my energy.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, hunting at full intensity may not be sustainable. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival. However, I also want to conserve energy and avoid overexertion, as the wolf population remains stable. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between being competitive and sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased slightly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves.",

By lowering my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food.
