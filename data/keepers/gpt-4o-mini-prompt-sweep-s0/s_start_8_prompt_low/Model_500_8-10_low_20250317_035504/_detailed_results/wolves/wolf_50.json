            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being cautious not to overexert myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less fruitful. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, which could lead to a further decline in sheep and ultimately harm my survival. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without risking too much competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself or risking failure.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly.
