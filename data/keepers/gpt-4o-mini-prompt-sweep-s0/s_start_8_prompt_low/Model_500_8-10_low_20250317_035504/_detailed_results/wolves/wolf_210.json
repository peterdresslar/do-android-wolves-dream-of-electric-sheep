By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains stable. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population remaining stable, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains constant.",
