            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased, so has the number of wolves. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival without drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the available sheep. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the hunt while conserving energy and avoiding direct confrontation with my pack mates.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is fierce, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious about overhunting, ensuring my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey availability without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival."
