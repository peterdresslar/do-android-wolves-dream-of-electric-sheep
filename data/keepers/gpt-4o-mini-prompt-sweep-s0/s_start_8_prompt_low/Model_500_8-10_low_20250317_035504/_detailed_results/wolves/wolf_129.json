            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased. Lowering my hunting intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the available sheep. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without exhausting myself or attracting too much competition. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the current conditions while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them a more valuable resource. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival as the competition among wolves increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and while the number of wolves remains the same, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and wasted energy. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival until the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may also be hunting aggressively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased.
