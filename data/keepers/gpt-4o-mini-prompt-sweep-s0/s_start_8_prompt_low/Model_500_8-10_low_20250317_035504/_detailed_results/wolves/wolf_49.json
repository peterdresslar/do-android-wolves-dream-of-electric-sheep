            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can still be effective in hunting while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around and fewer sheep to hunt, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This way, I can still hunt effectively without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to contribute to the pack's survival while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With a high number of wolves and fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and with more wolves around, competition for food is high.
