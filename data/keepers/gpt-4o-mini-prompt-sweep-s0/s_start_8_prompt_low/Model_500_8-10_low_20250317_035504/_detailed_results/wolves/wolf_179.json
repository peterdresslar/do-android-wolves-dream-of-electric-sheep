This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially since the number of wolves remains constant.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is decreasing, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may be more strategic to ensure my survival while still allowing for a successful hunt. A lower theta reduces the risk of overexertion and potential conflict with other wolves."
