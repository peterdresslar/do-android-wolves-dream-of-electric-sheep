            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With the number of wolves decreasing, a moderate intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack's survival. This way, I can ensure I have enough energy for future hunts and adapt to the changing dynamics."
