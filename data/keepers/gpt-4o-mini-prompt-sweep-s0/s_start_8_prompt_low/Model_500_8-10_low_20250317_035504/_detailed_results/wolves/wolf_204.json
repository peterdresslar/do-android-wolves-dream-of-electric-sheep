By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves has remained stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, which means there is more food available. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
