With the wolf population increasing, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.6, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial as the wolf population is increasing, leading to more competition for the remaining sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with 18 wolves competing for food, a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
