With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited prey.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing and the number of wolves remaining stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure enough resources without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. However, with an increase in the wolf population, I need to be more competitive to secure my share of the food. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with 19 wolves competing for food, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy minimizes the risk of overexertion and ensures my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the risk of overexertion while still taking advantage of the available resources. This way, I can ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy compared to maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves.
