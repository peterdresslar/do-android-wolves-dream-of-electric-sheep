By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can maximize my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has remained stable. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the number of wolves remaining constant."
