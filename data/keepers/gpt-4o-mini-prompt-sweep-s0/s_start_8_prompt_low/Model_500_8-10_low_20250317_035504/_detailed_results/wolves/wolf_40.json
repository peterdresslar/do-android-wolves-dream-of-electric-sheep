            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This balance allows me to survive while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around, a lower intensity can help me conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. Increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70 allows me to be more competitive against other wolves while still being mindful of the limited resources. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure my survival without overexerting myself. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the pack's success while conserving energy for future hunts, especially given the recent decrease in the wolf population."
