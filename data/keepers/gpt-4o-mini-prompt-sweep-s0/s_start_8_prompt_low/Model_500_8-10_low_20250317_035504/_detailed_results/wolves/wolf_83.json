            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less efficient. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources while still being cautious not to overexert myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still having a chance to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially since the competition for food is likely to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
