            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there are fewer prey available. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can take advantage of the available resources without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the dwindling prey and the presence of other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competition from other wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a better opportunity for hunting.

This balance helps ensure my survival while still taking advantage of the available resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is less intense.

However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt at a moderate intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves, I can afford to be more aggressive in my hunting strategy while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival while maximizing my chances of a successful hunt.",
