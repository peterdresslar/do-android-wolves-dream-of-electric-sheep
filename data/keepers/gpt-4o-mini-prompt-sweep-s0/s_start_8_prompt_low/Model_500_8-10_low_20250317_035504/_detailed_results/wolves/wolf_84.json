            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some successful hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts when conditions may improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, while still being mindful of the increasing wolf population. This way, I can ensure my survival without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is increasing among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the sheep population is low.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is also decreasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment.
