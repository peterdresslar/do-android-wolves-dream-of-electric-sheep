            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can catch enough food to survive. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment with fewer resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at a moderate intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
