            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while conserving energy for future hunts. A moderate intensity allows me to be efficient without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and exhaustion. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to secure food while still being mindful of my energy reserves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.30, I can better position myself to catch enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts, as the situation remains uncertain."
