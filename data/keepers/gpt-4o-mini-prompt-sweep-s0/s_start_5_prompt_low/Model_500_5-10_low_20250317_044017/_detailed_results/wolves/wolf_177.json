            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can balance the need for food while being cautious of overexertion and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is high among the wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey before other wolves do, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for dwindling resources, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still being cautious about the dwindling wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to the recent decline in their population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, especially since the overall wolf population has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a significant reduction in the wolf population, it may be wise to conserve energy and hunt less aggressively. This approach allows me to adapt to the current environment while still participating in hunting when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack"
