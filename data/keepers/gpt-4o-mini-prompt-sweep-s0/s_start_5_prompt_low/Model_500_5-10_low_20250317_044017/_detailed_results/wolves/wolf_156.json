            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, the competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, balancing my survival needs with the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining constant, hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a decline in the overall wolf population, a lower hunting intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them harder to catch. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey, especially as the competition among wolves has also decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a scarcity of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to unnecessary risks. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival."
