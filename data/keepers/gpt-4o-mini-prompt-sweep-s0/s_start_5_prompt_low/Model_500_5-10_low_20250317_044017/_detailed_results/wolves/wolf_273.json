            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, adapting to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a more favorable situation while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves still high, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still having a chance to catch food when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the declining wolf population. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling population of prey and competitors. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a notable decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially considering the recent decline in the wolf population. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",

With fewer sheep, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity.
