            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity to 0.80, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity to 0.65, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This allows me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available and a decline in the wolf population, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival."
