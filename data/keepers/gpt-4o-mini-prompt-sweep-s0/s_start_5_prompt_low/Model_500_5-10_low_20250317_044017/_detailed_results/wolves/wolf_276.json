            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has significantly decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for dwindling resources. This way, I can still survive while being strategic about my hunting efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, it may be wise to be cautious and avoid competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall population of wolves is also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while not overexerting myself in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting. This moderate approach allows for sustainable hunting without risking exhaustion or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment where resources are limited."
