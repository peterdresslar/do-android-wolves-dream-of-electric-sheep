            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves means more competition for the available sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure enough food for myself while still being mindful of the sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself, given the rising number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity may lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring I can survive in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around and fewer sheep to hunt, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more aggressive in hunting while still conserving some energy for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep.
