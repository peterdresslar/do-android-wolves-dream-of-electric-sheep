            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with the other wolves for the limited resources while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can balance the need to secure enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or risking failure against other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource environment."
