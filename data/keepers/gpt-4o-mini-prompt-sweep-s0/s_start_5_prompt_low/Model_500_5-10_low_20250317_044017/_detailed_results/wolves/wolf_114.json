            "I chose this theta because with an increasing number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high, and with only two wolves, there is enough food to sustain us without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can increase my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to survive without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can still hunt effectively while conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure enough food while still being mindful of the sheep population, which has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to secure enough food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need for food while being cautious of overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to secure food while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for scarce resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
