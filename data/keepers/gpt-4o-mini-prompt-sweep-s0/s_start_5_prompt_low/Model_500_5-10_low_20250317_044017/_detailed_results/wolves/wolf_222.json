            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the increased number of wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to hunt more aggressively to secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.75 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population still high, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and resources. This way, I can still contribute to the pack without overexerting myself in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival."
