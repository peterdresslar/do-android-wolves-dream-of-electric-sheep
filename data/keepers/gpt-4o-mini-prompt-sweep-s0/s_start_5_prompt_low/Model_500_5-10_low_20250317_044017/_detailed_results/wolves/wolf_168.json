With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt more aggressively while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a more favorable opportunity to hunt.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment.
