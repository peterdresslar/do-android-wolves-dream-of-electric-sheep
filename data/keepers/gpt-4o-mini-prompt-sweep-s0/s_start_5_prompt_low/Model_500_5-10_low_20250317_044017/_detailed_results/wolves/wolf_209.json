            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can still contribute to the hunt without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts while also avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in both sheep and wolves, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and depletion of resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves suggests a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially crowded hunting scenario.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is intensifying. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure enough food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
