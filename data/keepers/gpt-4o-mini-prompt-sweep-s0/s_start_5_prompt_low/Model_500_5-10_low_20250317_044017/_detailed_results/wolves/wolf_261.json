            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves in the area, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.65 balances the need for increased effort without overexerting myself, allowing for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food while avoiding overexertion. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without risking too much energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still participating in hunts. This strategy may help me survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion and risk of injury. This balance helps ensure my survival in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy may help ensure my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough food. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
