            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less sustainable. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can still contribute to the pack's success while conserving energy and ensuring my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself or risking failure in a high-stress environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival."
