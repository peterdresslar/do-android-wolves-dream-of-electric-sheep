            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure that there are enough sheep for future hunts while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, given the dwindling prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy may help ensure my survival in a competitive environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, it may be more strategic to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower hunting intensity allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being ready to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or risking failure against other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decline.
