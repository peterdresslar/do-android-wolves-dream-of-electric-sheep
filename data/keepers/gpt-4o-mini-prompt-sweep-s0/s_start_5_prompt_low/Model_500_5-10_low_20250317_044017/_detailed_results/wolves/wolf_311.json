            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while minimizing risk.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with a high number of wolves, competition for food is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention while still being able to hunt if necessary. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the declining wolf population, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less predictable. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially with the declining wolf population. This way, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and allow the sheep population to recover, which is crucial for my long-term survival. Additionally, with the recent decrease in the wolf population, a more cautious approach may help me avoid competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a dwindling population of prey. This moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still having a chance to catch food when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling population of prey. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without risking exhaustion.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and with fewer wolves, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with others for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population is lower and I want to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, which presents a good opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the caution required in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food may be less intense, allowing me to hunt with a moderate intensity.

By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the abundant prey while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be adjusting their strategies.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is less intense. With fewer wolves, I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity and conserve energy while still being able to catch enough sheep. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
