            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By adjusting my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, balancing my chances of survival with the need to secure food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself in a competitive environment. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial given the recent decline in the wolf population, which suggests competition for food is increasing.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity."
