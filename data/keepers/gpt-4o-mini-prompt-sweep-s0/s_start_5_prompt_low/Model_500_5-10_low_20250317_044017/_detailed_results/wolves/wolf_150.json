            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep indicates that food is becoming scarcer, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or attracting too much competition from other wolves. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself."
