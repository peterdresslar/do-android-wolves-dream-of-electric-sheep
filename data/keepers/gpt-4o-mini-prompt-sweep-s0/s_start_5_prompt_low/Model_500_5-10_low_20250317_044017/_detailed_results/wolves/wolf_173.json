            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion while still increasing my chances of catching prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure my survival without overexploiting the remaining sheep. A theta of 0.70 allows me to hunt effectively while also conserving resources for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to exhaustion or failure. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current environment while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, it may be more strategic to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to hunt more efficiently while still increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is likely to be fierce. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
