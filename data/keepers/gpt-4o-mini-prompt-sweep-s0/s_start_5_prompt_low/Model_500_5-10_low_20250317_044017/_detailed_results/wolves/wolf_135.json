            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly increased intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. With an increase in the wolf population, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.70 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to secure a meal. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions are more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and I need to balance my hunting efforts to ensure I can still find enough food without exhausting the remaining sheep too quickly. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive."
