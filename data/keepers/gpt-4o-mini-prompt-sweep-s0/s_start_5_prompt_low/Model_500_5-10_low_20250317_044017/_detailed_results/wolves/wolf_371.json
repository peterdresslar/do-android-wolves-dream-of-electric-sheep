            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has significantly decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when the chance arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is higher among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a scarce resource situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival until the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a dwindling population of prey. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for resources is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey."
