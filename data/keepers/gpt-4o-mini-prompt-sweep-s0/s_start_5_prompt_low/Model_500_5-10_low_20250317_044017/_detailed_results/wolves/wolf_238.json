            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased while the number of wolves has increased. This suggests that competition for food is rising, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the energy expenditure. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still relatively high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for the sheep population to recover."
