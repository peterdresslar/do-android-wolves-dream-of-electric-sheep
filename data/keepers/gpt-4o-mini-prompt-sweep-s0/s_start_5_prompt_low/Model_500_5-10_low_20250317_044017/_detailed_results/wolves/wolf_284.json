            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By adjusting my intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population still high, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this competitive situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a scarcity of resources. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being opportunistic in case a chance to hunt arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively, especially as the number of wolves has also decreased, indicating competition for food is less intense.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, as competition among wolves is still present. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to competition with other wolves and potential danger. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival."
