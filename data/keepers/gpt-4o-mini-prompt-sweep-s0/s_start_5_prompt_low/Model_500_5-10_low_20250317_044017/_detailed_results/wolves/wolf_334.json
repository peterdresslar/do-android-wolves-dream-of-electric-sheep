            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food for myself while still being cautious not to overexert and risk injury or depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less predictable. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking failure. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing conditions while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is higher among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts, as the sheep population is low.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition."
