            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a more sustainable way.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding competition for scarce resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition for scarce resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting may be less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can better compete for the limited resources while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, it is wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to hunt more strategically and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep suggests that hunting may be less successful at maximum intensity. By adjusting to a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without competing too fiercely with other wolves."
