            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less efficient. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment with fewer resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be less successful. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still conserving energy for future hunts, as I don't want to exhaust myself in a situation where resources are scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a dwindling population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a significant decrease in the wolf population, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival. By hunting less aggressively, I can avoid competition with other wolves and wait for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population indicates increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better secure food for myself while still conserving energy, as the sheep population has slightly increased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming more intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can better balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still being cautious about the dwindling sheep population."
