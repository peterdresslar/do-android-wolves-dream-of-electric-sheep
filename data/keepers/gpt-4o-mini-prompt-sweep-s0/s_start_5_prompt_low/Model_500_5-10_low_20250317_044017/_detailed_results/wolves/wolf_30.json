            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, and the number of wolves is increasing. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.20, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better secure food while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being cautious not to overexert myself and risk injury or exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This way, I can adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being effective in hunting. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a scarcity of resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
