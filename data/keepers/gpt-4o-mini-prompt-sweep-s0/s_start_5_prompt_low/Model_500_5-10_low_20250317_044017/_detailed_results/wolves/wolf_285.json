            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer until the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival given the declining population of both prey and competitors.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations suggests a need for a balanced approach. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can take advantage of the available prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a declining environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with a significant decrease in wolves, competition for food is high. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of success. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially as the number of wolves has also decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. With fewer sheep and a significant decrease in the wolf population, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival. By not competing at maximum intensity, I can avoid unnecessary risks and still have a chance to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves."
