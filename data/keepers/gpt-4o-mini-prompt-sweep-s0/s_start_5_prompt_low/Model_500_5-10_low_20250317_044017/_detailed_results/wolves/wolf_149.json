            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, so a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious not to overexert myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower theta allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population decreasing, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less fruitful. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the overall decrease in the wolf population, a more cautious approach may help me survive longer.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the current scarcity. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition."
