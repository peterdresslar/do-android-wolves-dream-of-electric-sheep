            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the wolf population remains high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at maximum intensity less sustainable. By lowering my intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may not be as fruitful as before. With fewer sheep available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing a meal.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in securing food. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
