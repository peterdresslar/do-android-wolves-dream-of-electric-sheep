            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to be more strategic and conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a competitive situation with fewer resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being proactive in hunting. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to unnecessary risks with the dwindling sheep population and competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
