            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still participating in the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still conserve energy while taking advantage of the increased wolf population, which may lead to more successful hunts if we work together. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling resource situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises."
