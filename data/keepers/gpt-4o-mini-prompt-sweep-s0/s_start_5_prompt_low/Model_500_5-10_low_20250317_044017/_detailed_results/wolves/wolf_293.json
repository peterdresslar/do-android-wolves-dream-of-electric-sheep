            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves than sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and depletion of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. A moderate intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure and the need to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the resource. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a dwindling environment while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting energy without a successful hunt. Additionally, the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is less fierce, allowing me to conserve energy while still being opportunistic.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
