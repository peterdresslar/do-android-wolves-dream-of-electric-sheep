            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving energy. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, increasing my hunting intensity will help me compete better for food. A theta of 0.75 allows me to be aggressive enough to secure a meal while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves around and fewer sheep to hunt, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with an increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for the remaining sheep will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
