            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, the competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of securing a meal while still being mindful of the risks involved in competing with others. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the caution required in a crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my intensity from 0.40 to 0.60, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling prey. This balance allows me to hunt effectively without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring a longer-term food source.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less fruitful. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competition from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to secure enough resources while not overexerting myself in a dwindling population."
