            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is rising. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, balancing the risk of overexertion with the need to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with a high number of wolves, competition for food is fierce. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still having a chance to catch prey. This strategy may help me survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. Hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival.",
