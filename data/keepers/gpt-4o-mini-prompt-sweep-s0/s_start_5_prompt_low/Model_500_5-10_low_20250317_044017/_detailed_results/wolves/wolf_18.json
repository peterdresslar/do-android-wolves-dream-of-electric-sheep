            "I chose this theta because with the increase in both sheep and wolves, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be fiercer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure food for myself while still conserving some energy for future hunts, balancing the need to compete with the available sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be tougher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey while still being cautious, as the increased number of wolves may lead to competition for food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still contributing to the pack's survival."
