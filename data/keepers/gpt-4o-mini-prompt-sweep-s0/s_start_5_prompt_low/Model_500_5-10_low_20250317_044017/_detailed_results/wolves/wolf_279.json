            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can balance the need for food while being cautious of overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food if I hunt at maximum intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment where resources are scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is also declining. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a declining prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially since the wolf population has also decreased. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep and a decline in the wolf population, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less predictable. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has decreased and competition may be less fierce.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a lower availability of food. With fewer sheep and a significant decrease in the wolf population, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment."
