            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By lowering my intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, as the increased number of wolves may lead to more competition for the remaining sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself."
