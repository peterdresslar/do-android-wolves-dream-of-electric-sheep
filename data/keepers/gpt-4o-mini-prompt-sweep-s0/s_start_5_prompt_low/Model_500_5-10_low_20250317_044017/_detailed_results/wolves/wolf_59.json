            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts without overexerting myself. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.65 balances the need for increased effort while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for dwindling resources. By adjusting my hunting intensity, I can still contribute to the pack while ensuring my own survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the overall decline in sheep and the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
