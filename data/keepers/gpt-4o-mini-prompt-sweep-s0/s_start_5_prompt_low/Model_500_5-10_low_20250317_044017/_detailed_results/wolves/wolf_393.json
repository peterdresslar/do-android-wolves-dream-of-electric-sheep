            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being ready to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of starvation. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential overhunting. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I aim to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure I get enough food without overexerting myself, as other wolves may be competing fiercely for the remaining sheep. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
