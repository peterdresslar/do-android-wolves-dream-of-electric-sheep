            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarce. With fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a notable decline in their population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive among the other wolves while still being mindful of the dwindling prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and with a decrease in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my own survival in a challenging environment.",
