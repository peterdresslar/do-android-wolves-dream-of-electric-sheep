            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance may help me survive longer in a challenging environment where resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the increased wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population still high, hunting at full intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious about the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food if I hunt at maximum intensity. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while conserving energy and minimizing risk in a declining population of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decline. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack's survival. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can better balance the need for food while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the wolf population has also decreased."
