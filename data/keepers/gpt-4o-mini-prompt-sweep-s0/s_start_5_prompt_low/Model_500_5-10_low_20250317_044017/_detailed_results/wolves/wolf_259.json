            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be tougher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better ensure my survival while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance allows me to hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that prey is becoming scarcer. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still participating in the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
