            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a less favorable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.
