            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy, as the wolf population has increased and competition is high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population still high, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and depletion of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and reducing the risk of overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available and a large number of wolves competing for food, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce the risk of failure in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, especially since the wolf population has also decreased. This allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. With fewer sheep and a significant decrease in the number of wolves, a lower hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This strategy balances the need for survival with the current scarcity of resources."
