            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By adjusting my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still being effective enough to catch prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the increasing number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can strike a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of securing food. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially considering the recent decline in the wolf population. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch some food. Additionally, with the recent decline in the wolf population, being more cautious may increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment."
