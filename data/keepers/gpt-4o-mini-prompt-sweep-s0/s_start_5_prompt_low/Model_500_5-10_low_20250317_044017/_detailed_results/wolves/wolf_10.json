            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack's success while minimizing the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because with the sheep population increasing, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance my energy expenditure while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is intensifying. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the number of wolves suggests more competition for food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the number of wolves, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure enough food for survival while still being mindful of energy conservation. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a sustainable hunt without overexerting myself. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can take advantage of the current sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and still have a chance to catch prey without overexerting myself. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for resources will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure enough food while still being mindful of the sheep population, which has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in hunts.
