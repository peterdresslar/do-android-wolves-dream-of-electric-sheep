            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better compete with the other wolves for the remaining sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with fewer sheep and a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, it is wise to balance my hunting intensity. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially as the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decline.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of confrontation with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still ensuring I have enough energy to survive."
