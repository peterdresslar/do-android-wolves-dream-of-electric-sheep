            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can take advantage of the current situation while still being cautious, as the wolf population has increased and competition for food is higher.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not yield enough food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in wolves suggests that competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This way, I can adapt to the declining prey availability without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or danger from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This approach allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, there's a better chance of successfully hunting without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food."
