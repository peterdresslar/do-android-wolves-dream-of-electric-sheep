            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the hunt while being mindful of the overall situation and ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population indicates more competition for food. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure enough food while not overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the conditions are more favorable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting intensity should be adjusted to ensure sustainability. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can still contribute to the pack's needs while allowing some sheep to survive for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where food is scarce. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment."
