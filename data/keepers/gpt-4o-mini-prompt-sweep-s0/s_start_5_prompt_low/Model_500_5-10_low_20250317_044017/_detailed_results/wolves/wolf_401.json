            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. With more wolves around, competition for food is increasing, and a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexploitation of the remaining sheep. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still secure enough resources without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep and a significant drop in the wolf population, a moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a less favorable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",

This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion. This will help me secure food while still being cautious in a competitive environment."
