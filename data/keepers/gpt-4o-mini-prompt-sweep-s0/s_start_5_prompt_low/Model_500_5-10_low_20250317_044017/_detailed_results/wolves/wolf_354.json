            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and conflict. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid confrontations while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for limited resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious about the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a scarce resource situation."
