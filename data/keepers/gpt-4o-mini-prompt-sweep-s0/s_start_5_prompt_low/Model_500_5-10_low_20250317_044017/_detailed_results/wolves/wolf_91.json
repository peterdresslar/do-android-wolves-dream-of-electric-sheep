            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less predictable. By reducing my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still participating in hunts, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid overexertion. This balanced approach increases my chances of survival as I navigate the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being able to hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, given the declining wolf population. This balance helps ensure my survival while being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
