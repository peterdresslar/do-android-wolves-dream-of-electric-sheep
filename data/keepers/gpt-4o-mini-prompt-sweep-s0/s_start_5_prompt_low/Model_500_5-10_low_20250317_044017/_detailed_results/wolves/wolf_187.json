            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still participating in the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still increasing my chances of catching prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to ensure sustainability. By increasing my intensity from 0.30 to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while also considering the overall health of the prey population and my own survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balanced approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decline. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, it may be wise to avoid competition and hunt more strategically.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves has also reduced. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I still have energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a significant decrease in the wolf population, it may be wise to conserve energy and hunt less aggressively. This will help ensure my survival in a challenging environment where competition for food is high.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a tougher environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overhunting could lead to competition with other wolves and further depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this challenging environment. This way, I can still hunt effectively without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
