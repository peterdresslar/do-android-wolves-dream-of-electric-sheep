            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure to catch prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially with an increase in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial given the rising number of wolves competing for the same prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better compete for limited resources while still conserving energy. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling population."
