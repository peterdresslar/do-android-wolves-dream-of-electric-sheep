            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves in the pack, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexertion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can still be effective in securing food while conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
