            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 5 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition among my pack, risking injury or exhaustion. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt at a moderate intensity. This balance allows me to contribute to the pack's success while also conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with fewer wolves, I need to balance my intensity to ensure I can catch enough food while not overexerting myself. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively without risking too much energy."
