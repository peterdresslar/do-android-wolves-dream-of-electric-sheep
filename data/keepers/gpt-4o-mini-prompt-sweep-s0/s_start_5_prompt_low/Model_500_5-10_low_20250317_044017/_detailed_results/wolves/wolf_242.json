            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the energy expenditure. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival given the recent trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, giving me a better chance of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
