            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity to 0.80, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially with the increased number of wolves competing for the same prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
