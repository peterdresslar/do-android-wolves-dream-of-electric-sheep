            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. With more wolves and fewer sheep, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy balances my need for food with the risk of overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for dwindling prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can balance the need for food while being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this tough environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey availability while still being cautious of the competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a competitive environment. This way, I can still contribute to my survival without exhausting my energy or attracting too much attention from other wolves."
