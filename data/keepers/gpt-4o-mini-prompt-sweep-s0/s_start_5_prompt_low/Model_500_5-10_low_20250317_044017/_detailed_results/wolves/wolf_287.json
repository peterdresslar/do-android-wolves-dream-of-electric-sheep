            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for food. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not yield enough food. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current scarcity and ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while also being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling prey environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, it's wise to be cautious and not overexert myself in a competitive environment.",
