            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves than sheep, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and conserves energy, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to wasted energy if the hunt fails.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, which could lead to depletion of resources or attracting attention from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while avoiding overexertion that could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at a higher intensity could lead to competition with other wolves. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling prey and the need to conserve energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for the limited resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while not overexerting myself in a competitive environment. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and ensure my survival without risking too much energy.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious, as the overall wolf population is lower and I need to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is less intense.
