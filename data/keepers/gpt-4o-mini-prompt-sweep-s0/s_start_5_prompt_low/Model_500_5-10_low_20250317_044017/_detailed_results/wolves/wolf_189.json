            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion in a declining prey environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food if I hunt at maximum intensity. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce the risk of competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still seeking food.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, I need to be strategic and avoid competition with other wolves who may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, especially since the wolf population has also decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being mindful of the dwindling prey and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the recent decrease in wolves suggests competition for food is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves while still being able to catch prey if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to secure enough resources while still conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still having a chance to catch prey if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the risk of overexertion with the potential reward of catching prey, while also considering that other wolves may be competing for the same resources."
