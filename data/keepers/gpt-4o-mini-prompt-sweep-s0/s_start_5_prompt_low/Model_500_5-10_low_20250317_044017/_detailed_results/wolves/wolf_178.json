            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for all. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food and the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can ensure that I contribute to the sustainability of the prey population while still securing enough food for myself. This approach balances my immediate needs with the long-term survival of both myself and my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep indicates a scarcity of food, and with fewer wolves, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to be more strategic in my hunting while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing situation without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population has also decreased.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury in a dwindling population of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not yield enough food. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. It allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment.
