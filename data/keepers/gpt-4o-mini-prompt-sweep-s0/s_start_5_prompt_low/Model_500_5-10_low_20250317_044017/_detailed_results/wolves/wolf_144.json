            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of successfully hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is intensifying. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure food for myself while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity increases my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion in a declining prey environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's needs. This cautious approach allows for sustainable hunting and increases my chances of survival in a declining wolf population."
