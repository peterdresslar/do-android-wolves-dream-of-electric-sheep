            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to secure a meal. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexertion while still increasing my chances of catching prey. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a more valuable resource. With the increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or competing too aggressively with other wolves. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This cautious approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not very high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment."
