            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity can help conserve energy while still allowing for successful hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough food. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt with a bit more intensity without risking overexertion. This balance allows me to secure food while being mindful of the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure food for myself while still being cautious, as the sheep population is relatively low. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and with the recent decrease in the wolf population, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and increase my chances of survival. By not competing at maximum intensity, I can avoid unnecessary confrontations with other wolves and still have a chance to catch prey when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is less intense. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still compete for food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future needs.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is fierce. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased while the number of wolves has decreased. This suggests that there may be less competition for food, allowing me to hunt at a lower intensity while still being effective. A lower theta also conserves energy for future hunts, which is crucial for my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the number of sheep increasing and the wolf population stable, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while minimizing competition with other wolves. This way, I can still secure a meal without overexerting myself or risking injury.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a good opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially since the number of wolves remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival while still being cautious about the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, indicating more food availability. However, with the number of wolves remaining the same, I need to be more competitive to secure my share. A slightly higher intensity than my previous choice will help me capitalize on the increased prey while still being mindful of energy conservation.",
            "I chose this theta because while the sheep population has increased, the number of wolves remains stable. By reducing my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself.
