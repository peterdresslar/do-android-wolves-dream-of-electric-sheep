            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still significantly higher than the number of wolves, allowing for a more cautious approach. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can contribute to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means there is enough food available. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food for survival without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the declining sheep population. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at a slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a more favorable situation while still contributing to the pack"
