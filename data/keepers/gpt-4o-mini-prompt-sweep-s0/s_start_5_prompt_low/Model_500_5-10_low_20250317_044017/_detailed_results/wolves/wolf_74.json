            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.65 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. A balance is necessary to ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a notable decrease in their population. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to exhaustion or failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being cautious about the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive in a challenging environment while still being able to hunt effectively when the sheep population increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment."
