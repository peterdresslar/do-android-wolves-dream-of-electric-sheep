            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of not overexerting myself, given the recent decrease in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. With the sheep population decreasing, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance the need to secure food while avoiding overexertion and risking injury. This way, I can still contribute to my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexertion or failure in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. With the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves, a balanced approach will help ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
