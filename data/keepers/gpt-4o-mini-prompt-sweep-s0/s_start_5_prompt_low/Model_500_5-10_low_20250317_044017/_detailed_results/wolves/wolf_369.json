            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is higher among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the declining prey and pack size, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer wolves around, a lower hunting intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for a successful hunt. This strategy reduces competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
