            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success without overexerting myself in a less favorable hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can maximize my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with more wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for diminishing resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting may be more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and avoid competing directly with other wolves for limited resources. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for a more favorable situation to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
