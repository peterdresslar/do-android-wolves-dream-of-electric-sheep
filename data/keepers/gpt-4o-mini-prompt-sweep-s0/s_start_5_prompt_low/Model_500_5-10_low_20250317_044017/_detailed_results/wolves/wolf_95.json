            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by reducing competition for dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By adjusting my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need to secure food without overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment with fewer resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, it's wise to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. A lower theta allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still maintaining a chance to catch prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself, allowing for a sustainable approach to survival while other wolves may be competing aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the declining resources while still participating in the hunt. This approach increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks. A moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This way, I can ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, while the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that there may be more opportunities for hunting without overwhelming competition from other wolves. A moderate intensity will allow me to conserve energy while still taking advantage of the available prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
