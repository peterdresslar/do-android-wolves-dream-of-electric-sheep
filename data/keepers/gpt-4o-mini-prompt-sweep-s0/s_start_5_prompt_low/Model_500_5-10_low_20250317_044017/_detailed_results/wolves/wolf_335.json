            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has increased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential overhunting. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the remaining sheep. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available and a decrease in the wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I can still survive while being mindful of the dwindling resources."
