            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective enough to catch prey, balancing the need for survival with the current scarcity of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or attracting too much attention from other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation. With fewer sheep and a decrease in the wolf population, a more conservative approach will help ensure my survival and allow for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival, especially as the competition among wolves increases.",
