            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure to secure food. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the situation while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it more challenging to find food. With the wolf population increasing, competition for resources will be high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still participating in the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself or risking injury. A moderate intensity allows me to be more strategic in my hunting approach while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run."
