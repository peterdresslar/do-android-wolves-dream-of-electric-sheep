            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the remaining sheep. A theta of 0.65 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. However, the wolf population has increased, leading to more competition. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the limited resources available.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to failure in catching prey or attracting too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the changing conditions while still contributing to the pack"
