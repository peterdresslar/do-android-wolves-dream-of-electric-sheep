With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.65 allows me to hunt more aggressively while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the changing conditions while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without risking too much competition with others.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer while still contributing to the pack"
