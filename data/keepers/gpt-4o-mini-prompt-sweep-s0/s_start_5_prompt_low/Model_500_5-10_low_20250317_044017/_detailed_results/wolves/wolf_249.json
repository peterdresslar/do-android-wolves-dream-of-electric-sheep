            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it less likely to find enough food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. However, with the increase in the wolf population, I need to be more competitive to secure food. A theta of 0.60 allows me to hunt with moderate intensity, balancing the need for food while conserving energy for potential future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition with other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of confrontation with other wolves while still being able to secure enough food for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to take advantage of the remaining sheep while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a dwindling resource environment."
