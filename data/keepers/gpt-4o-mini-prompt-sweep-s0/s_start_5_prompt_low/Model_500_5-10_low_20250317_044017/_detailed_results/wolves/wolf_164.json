With more wolves around, I need to be cautious and not overexert myself while still increasing my chances of catching prey. A slightly higher intensity than before allows me to adapt to the changing environment without risking exhaustion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making it more challenging to find food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially with the increase in the wolf population competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there is less food available. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the competition with other wolves remains high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy and resources, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a dwindling prey situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and the competition among wolves is high due to the recent decrease in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being prepared to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
