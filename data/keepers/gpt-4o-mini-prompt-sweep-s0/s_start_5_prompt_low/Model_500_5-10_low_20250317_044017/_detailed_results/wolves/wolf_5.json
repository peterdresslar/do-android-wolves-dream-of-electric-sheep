            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 5 sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with my pack, reducing my chances of getting a meal. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too fiercely with other wolves, which may lead to better survival chances in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without overexerting myself and risking injury or exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the same prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. However, with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while avoiding overexertion and risking my own survival. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with 7.11 sheep and 5 wolves, the competition for food is moderate. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
