            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition among wolves for food is likely to increase. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can balance the need to secure enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food is likely to be higher among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This cautious approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival until the sheep population recovers."
