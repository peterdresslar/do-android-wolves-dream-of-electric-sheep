            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure enough food while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with a high number of wolves, competition for food is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself, which could lead to exhaustion or danger from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still allowing for future hunting opportunities as the sheep population stabilizes."
