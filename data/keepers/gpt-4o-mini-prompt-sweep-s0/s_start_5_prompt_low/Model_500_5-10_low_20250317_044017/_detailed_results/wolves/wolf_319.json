            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while also considering the increased competition from other wolves. By not hunting at maximum intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion, which is crucial in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This strategy allows me to survive in a crowded environment where resources may become scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while not overexerting myself, as the situation is still precarious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in the long run."
