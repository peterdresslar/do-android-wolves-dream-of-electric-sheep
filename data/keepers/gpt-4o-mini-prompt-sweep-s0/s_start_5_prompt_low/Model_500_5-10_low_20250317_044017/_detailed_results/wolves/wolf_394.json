            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a less favorable environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population suggests competition for resources is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexertion without a sufficient return. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decline. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
