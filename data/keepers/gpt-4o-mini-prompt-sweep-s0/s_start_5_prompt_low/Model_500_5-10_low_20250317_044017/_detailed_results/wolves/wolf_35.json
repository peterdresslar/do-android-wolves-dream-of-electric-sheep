            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With more wolves in the area, hunting at a higher intensity could lead to competition and risk. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still conserving some energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a more favorable opportunity to hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population declining. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment."
