            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure food while still conserving energy, as the wolf population has also increased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not very high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, which could lead to unnecessary risks. A moderate approach allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With fewer sheep and a significant drop in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity.
