            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy helps ensure my survival by avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy balances the need to survive with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy, as the sheep are fewer and more cautious. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a more favorable situation. This approach allows me to survive longer while still being able to hunt when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as overexertion could lead to depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With fewer sheep, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting resources and allows for a more sustainable approach to hunting. This strategy also helps me conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment where other wolves are also hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for survival. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to the pack"
