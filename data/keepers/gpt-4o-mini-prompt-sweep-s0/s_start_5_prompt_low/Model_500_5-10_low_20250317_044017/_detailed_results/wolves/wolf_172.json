            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at full intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overhunting, ensuring my survival while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach also considers the competition with other wolves who are hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that food is scarce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, who are also struggling. This strategy may help me survive longer until the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival while still allowing me to secure food when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy may increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food while conserving energy. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially since the wolf population has also decreased.",
