            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting too much attention while still being able to hunt effectively. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable at maximum intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a competitive situation. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still ensuring I have enough energy to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment."
