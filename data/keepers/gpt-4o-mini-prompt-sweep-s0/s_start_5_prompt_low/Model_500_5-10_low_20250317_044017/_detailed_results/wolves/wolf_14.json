This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but so has the number of wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the higher sheep population while still being cautious about competition from other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, allowing me to adapt to the rising competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still being mindful of the need to conserve energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure to secure a meal. By increasing my intensity slightly, I can balance the need for food while being cautious of overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure food while still being mindful of the dwindling sheep population. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",

This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for the limited prey.",
