            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for the available sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A theta of 0.75 allows me to hunt effectively while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for food while still being mindful of the risks of overexertion. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between maximizing my hunting efforts and conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.75 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food is increasing. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy may increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack"
