            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.80, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the hunt. This also allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the wolf population, which has increased, making competition for food more intense.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has significantly decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting too much attention while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population, ensuring my survival without risking too much competition with others.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, considering the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is still high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This strategy also helps me avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at full intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food.
