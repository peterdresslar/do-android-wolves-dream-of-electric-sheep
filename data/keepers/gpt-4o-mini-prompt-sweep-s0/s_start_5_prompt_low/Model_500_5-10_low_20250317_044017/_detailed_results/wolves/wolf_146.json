With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is higher, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for opportunistic hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without exhausting myself.
