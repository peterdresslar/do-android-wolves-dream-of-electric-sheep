            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This way, I can still hunt effectively without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when the sheep population stabilizes or increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep is decreasing, which means food is becoming scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the overall decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious, as the overall population of wolves is declining. This balance allows me to adapt to the situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This approach balances the need to survive with the current scarcity of resources, reducing the risk of overexertion and potential failure in catching prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting myself could lead to exhaustion or injury. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without risking too much energy."
