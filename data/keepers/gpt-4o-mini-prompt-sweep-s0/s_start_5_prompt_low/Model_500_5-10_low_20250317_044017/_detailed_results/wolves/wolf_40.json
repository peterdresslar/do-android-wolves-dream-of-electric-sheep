            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy and still contribute to the pack's success without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough prey without overexerting myself, especially since the number of wolves has increased. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the limited prey. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves.
