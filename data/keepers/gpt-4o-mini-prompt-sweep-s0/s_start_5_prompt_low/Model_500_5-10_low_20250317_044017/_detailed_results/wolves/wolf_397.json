            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting if the chance arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a higher intensity will increase my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the competition. A theta of 0.60 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing conditions without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I still have energy to evade potential threats from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help us avoid overexertion and ensure we have enough resources without risking starvation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, it may be wise to be more cautious and strategic in my approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
