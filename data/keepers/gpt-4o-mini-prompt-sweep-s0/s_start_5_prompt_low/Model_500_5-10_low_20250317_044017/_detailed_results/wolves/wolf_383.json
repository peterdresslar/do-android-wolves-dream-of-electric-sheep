            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and risk of failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity (theta=1) could lead to competition and potential failure to secure food. By choosing a moderate intensity (theta=0.50), I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting, risking starvation. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing conditions and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, balancing the need for food with the risk of overexertion in a dwindling population of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to competition with other wolves. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, and the wolf population has also declined significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can still contribute to the pack's survival while being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling resource environment. This balance helps ensure my survival while adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With fewer sheep and a significant drop in the wolf population, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment."
