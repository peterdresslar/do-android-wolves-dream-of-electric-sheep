            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself, ensuring my survival in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can better secure food for myself while still being mindful of the sheep population, which has decreased. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population still high, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid attracting too much attention from other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
