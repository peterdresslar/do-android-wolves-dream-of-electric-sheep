By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete with other wolves while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",

With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, it",
