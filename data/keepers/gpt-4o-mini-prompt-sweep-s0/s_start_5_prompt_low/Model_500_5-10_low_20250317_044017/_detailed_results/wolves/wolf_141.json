            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy for future hunts. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for a better opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and while the wolf population has increased, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when the chance arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my needs with the current prey availability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows for a more sustainable approach, ensuring that I can survive longer without depleting the food source too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I remain competitive without exhausting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, I need to balance my hunting intensity to conserve energy while still being effective. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself."
