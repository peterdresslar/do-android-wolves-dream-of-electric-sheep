            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough food without overexerting myself. A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being competitive with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent decline in both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, I need to be strategic about my energy use to ensure my survival."
