            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the sheep while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, competition for food is high, and a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure to catch prey. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of success in a more strategic manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially as the wolf population has also decreased."
