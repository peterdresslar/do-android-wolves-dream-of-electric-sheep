            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting at full intensity less sustainable. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for better conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious of competition from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still participating in hunts when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By adjusting to a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment."
