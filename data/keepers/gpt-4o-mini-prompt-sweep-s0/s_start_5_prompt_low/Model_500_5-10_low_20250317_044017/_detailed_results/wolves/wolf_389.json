            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for better opportunities while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a competitive environment where other wolves are also struggling.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of confrontation with other wolves, while still allowing for a chance to catch prey if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep and a declining wolf population, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation. With fewer sheep and a significant decrease in the wolf population, a lower intensity allows for a more sustainable approach to hunting while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decline. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This cautious approach helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment."
