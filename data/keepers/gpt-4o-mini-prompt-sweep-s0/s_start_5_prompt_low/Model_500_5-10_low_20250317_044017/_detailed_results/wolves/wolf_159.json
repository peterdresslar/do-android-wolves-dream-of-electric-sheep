            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This balance will help ensure my survival in a more competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows me to adapt to the changing environment without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as overexerting could lead to failure in catching prey or attracting unwanted attention from other wolves."
