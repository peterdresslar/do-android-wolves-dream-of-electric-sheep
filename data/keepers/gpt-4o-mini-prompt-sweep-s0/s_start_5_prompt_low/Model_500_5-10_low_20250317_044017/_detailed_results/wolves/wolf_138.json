            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when necessary. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources while still being cautious not to overexert myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting opportunities. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting intensity needs to be balanced. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving energy in case the situation worsens. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts. This balance may help ensure my survival as resources are scarce.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack"
