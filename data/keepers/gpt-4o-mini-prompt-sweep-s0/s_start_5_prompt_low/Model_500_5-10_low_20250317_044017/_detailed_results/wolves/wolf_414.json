With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.65 allows me to balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention from other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This cautious approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for the limited prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct confrontation, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a dwindling population.",

            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low and the risk of overexertion is high. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer sheep, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is becoming less intense. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to a moderate level, ensuring I can catch enough sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, indicating a potential for a successful hunt.
