            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This strategy increases my chances of survival by avoiding competition with other wolves for the limited sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the increased competition from other wolves. A theta of 0.65 strikes a balance between being aggressive enough to hunt effectively and conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack's success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still participating in hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This cautious approach increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may lead to exhaustion or injury. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decrease.

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt with moderate intensity. This balance allows me to secure food without overexerting myself or risking confrontation with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer wolves around, competition for food is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in this challenging environment."
