            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure to catch prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current scarcity while still contributing to the pack's survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, it is wise to conserve energy and reduce hunting intensity. This will help me survive longer in a challenging environment where competition among wolves is high.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the recent decrease in wolves indicates competition for food is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in securing food.
