By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of securing food while still being cautious not to overexert myself, given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher.

A moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
