            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.25, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure with the need to secure enough food while avoiding overexertion in a crowded environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can balance the need to secure enough food while not overexerting myself, allowing for sustainable hunting without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a more favorable hunting opportunity.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still contributing to the pack's survival. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the declining wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious about the dwindling prey and competition."
