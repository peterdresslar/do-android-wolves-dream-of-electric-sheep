With fewer sheep, a lower intensity reduces the risk of overexertion and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, I need to be strategic and avoid competition with other wolves who may also be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is also declining. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being proactive in hunting. This balanced approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and reduce the risk of overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is increasing. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure my own survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",

By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing too much attention to myself, increasing my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",

This moderate intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",

            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population and the slight increase in sheep, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding competition with other wolves. This approach increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a better opportunity for hunting. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition is still fierce. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can take advantage of the sheep while still being cautious about the risks posed by other wolves.",
