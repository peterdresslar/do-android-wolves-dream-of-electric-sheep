            "I chose this theta because with 10 wolves and only 5 sheep, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This way, I can avoid competing too aggressively with my pack and increase my chances of survival in a scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and with fewer wolves around, I can afford to hunt with moderate intensity. This will help me conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt, ensuring my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival while still being cautious about competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the number of wolves has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of our pack and the available prey, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, indicating a potential for more food. However, the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition is lower, so I can afford to hunt at a lower intensity to conserve energy and avoid overexertion. This balance helps ensure my survival while still allowing for successful hunting."
