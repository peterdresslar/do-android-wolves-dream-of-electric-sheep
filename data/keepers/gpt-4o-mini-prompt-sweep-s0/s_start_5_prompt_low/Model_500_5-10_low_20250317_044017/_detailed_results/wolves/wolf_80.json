            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being effective enough to catch prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarce. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still contributing to the pack's efforts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and potential failure. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to adapt to the current situation while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not yield enough food to sustain myself and could lead to unnecessary competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is high. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion, which is crucial for my survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment."
