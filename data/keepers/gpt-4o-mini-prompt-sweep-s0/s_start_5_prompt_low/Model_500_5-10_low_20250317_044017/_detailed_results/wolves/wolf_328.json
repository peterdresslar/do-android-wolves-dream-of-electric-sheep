            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still contributing to the pack's overall success. This strategy allows me to survive longer in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of wolves has increased significantly, which means competition for food is higher. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. However, the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can balance the need to secure enough food while still being cautious of overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, given the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is fierce. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
