            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the rising wolf population. This way, I can adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate increase in theta allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of catching enough prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the recent decline in the wolf population, I need to be cautious and strategic in my approach to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their numbers. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling prey and the competition from other wolves.",
