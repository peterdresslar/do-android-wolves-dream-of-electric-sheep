            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while still conserving energy, as the overall wolf population is also declining. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable given the current low sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their recent decline. A lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decrease. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need to secure food while also conserving energy and avoiding overexertion in a competitive environment.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting attention from other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing circumstances without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt with moderate intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival while still being cautious, as the sheep population is relatively low and I need to conserve energy.",

By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt with moderate intensity.
