            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for the available sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the increase in the number of wolves, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary risks while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid overexerting myself while still contributing to the pack's survival. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition for dwindling resources. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolf populations indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. A theta of 0.30 allows me to be more competitive without overexerting myself in a declining population."
