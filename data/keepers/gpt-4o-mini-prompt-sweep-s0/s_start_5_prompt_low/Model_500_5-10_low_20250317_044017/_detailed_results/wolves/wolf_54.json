            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. This suggests that competition for food is intensifying. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my survival with the need to secure food.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure I can secure enough food for survival. A theta of 0.70 balances the need to hunt effectively while still being mindful of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balance allows me to survive while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, allowing me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the changing environment without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, especially considering the recent decline in the wolf population. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
