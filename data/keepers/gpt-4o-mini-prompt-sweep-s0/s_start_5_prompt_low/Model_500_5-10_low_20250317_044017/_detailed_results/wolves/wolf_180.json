            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still participating in hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to avoid competition while still ensuring I can catch enough food. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy and be more strategic in my hunting approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing my needs with the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This balance may help ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while conserving energy, as overexerting myself may not yield enough rewards in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable and could lead to exhaustion or failure to catch prey. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current situation and increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competing with other wolves. This approach allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy for potential future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, it is wise to conserve energy and reduce hunting intensity. This will help me avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling to find food, while still allowing me to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating that food is becoming scarcer. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to balance my energy expenditure with the likelihood of a successful hunt. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch prey. This strategy reduces competition with other wolves and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the number of wolves has decreased significantly.
