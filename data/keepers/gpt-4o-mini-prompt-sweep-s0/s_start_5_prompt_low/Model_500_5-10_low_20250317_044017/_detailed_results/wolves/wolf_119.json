            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance allows me to survive longer in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is still relatively high compared to the number of wolves, which means competition for food is increasing. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing a meal while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing pack.",
            "I chose this theta because with an increase in the wolf population, competition for food is higher. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid overhunting the sheep, ensuring that I have enough resources to survive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexerting myself in a situation where prey is scarce. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current environment while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means hunting is becoming more competitive. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving some energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the wolf population is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating that hunting intensity needs to be higher to ensure a successful hunt. However, I want to balance my energy expenditure and avoid overexertion, as the wolf population remains constant. A theta of 0.75 allows me to increase my chances of catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and avoid competing too aggressively with other wolves, which may also be struggling. This approach allows me to adapt to the current environment while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise."
