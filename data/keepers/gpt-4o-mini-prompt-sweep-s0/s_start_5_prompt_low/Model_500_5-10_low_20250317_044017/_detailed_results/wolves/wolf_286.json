            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still participating in the hunt. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential overexertion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better compete for food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is not high. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the scarcity of prey while still ensuring I have enough resources to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for a chance to catch some food. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially with the recent decline in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at a moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, I need to be strategic about my energy use to ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to hunt effectively while conserving energy, as the overall wolf population has also decreased. This allows me to adapt to the changing environment and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment."
