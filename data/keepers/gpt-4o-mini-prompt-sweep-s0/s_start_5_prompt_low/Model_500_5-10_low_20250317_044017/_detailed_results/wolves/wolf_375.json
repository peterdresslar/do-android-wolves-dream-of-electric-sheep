            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting success.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means food is scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a competitive environment with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself in a dwindling population of prey and competitors. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, while still allowing for potential success in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increase my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
