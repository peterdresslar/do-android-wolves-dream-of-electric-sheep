            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means more competition for food. With fewer sheep available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and avoid overexploitation of the dwindling sheep population. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for conditions to improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them more scarce. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to competition and less food for everyone. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the overall situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This allows me to be more efficient in hunting while still conserving energy, which is crucial for survival in a declining population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival in a declining wolf population.",
