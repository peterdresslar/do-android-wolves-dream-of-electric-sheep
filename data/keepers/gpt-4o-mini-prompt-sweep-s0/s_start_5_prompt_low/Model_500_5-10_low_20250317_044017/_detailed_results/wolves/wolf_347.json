            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A slightly lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to secure enough food for survival while still being cautious not to overexert myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is still relatively low. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the recent decrease in both sheep and wolves suggests that hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity when prey is more abundant, ensuring my survival in the long run."
