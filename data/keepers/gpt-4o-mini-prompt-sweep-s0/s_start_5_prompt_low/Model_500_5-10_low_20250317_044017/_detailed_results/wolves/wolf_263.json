            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity reduces the risk of competition and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts when conditions may improve.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with a high number of wolves, competition for food is fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can improve my chances of securing food while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival, especially as the competition among wolves is intensifying.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is also declining. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey while still having a chance to catch food when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population also declining, hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. A lower intensity may also help me adapt to the current scarcity of prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This way, I can adapt to the changing environment and increase my chances of survival without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be hunting aggressively. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself."
