            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still conserving energy compared to the maximum intensity. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy while still being competitive in the hunt. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, especially with an increasing number of wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching enough food to survive.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or drawing too much attention from other wolves."
