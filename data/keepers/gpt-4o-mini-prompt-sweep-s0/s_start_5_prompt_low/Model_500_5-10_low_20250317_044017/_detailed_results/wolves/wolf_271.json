            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more competitive among wolves. By lowering my intensity slightly, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt. This strategy allows me to adapt to the changing environment and increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the population of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. However, the number of wolves has increased, which means competition for food is higher. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still being mindful of the risks posed by other wolves. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between being aggressive enough to hunt effectively and cautious enough to avoid overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with the wolf population still high, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and depletion of resources. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid attracting too much attention from other wolves while still being able to hunt effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the overall wolf population is also declining. A lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and resources while still allowing me to hunt effectively. This strategy may also reduce competition with other wolves who are likely to be hunting at maximum intensity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the situation without overexerting myself, ensuring I can still survive while being cautious of the competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly.
