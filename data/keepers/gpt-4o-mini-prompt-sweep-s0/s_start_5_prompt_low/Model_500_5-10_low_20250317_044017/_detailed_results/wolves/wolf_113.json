By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also struggling. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, as competition among wolves is high and resources are limited.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also declining. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, balancing the need for survival with the current scarcity of resources.",

With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, allowing me to adapt to the changing situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves remaining the same, hunting at maximum intensity may lead to overexploitation of the remaining sheep. A lower intensity allows for a more sustainable approach, ensuring that I can survive while also allowing the sheep population to recover."
