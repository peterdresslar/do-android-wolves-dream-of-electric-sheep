            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This balance allows me to survive while still being ready to hunt if the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and with fewer wolves around, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the number of wolves is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the dwindling sheep. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's needs, balancing my survival with the current scarcity of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to overexploitation of the remaining prey. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious, as other wolves may also be competing for the same resources. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity reduces the risk of exhausting myself and allows me to conserve energy for future hunts. Additionally, with the wolf population decreasing, I need to be strategic and avoid competing too aggressively with others.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance may help ensure I have enough resources without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, I need to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are also hunting at maximum intensity. A lower theta allows me to hunt more strategically and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack's needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer wolves around, the competition for food is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival until conditions improve."
