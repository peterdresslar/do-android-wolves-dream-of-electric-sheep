            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making it harder to find food. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable at maximum intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still being able to hunt if the opportunity arises. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still conserving energy, as the competition among wolves is high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable, and I need to conserve energy for future hunts. A lower intensity allows me to adapt to the current situation while still contributing to my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the population of wolves is also declining. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of a successful hunt. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while still being cautious. This allows me to adapt to the scarcity of prey and the competition from other wolves, ensuring my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a lower hunting intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation while still having a chance to catch prey when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and with fewer wolves around, hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves. This strategy allows me to be more strategic in my hunting while still having a chance to catch prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the current situation without risking overexertion, which could lead to exhaustion or injury. A moderate approach allows me to contribute to the pack's survival while still being cautious.",
