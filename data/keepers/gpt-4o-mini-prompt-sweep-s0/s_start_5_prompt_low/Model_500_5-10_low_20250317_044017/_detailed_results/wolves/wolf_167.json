            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for opportunistic hunting when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.60 strikes a balance between conserving energy and increasing my chances of a successful hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating less food availability. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in sheep indicates a scarcity of food, and with fewer wolves, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself. A moderate increase in intensity allows me to be more competitive while still conserving energy.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves has intensified with their recent decline. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can take advantage of the remaining sheep while still conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself in a challenging environment."
