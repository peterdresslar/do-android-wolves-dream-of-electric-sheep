            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By lowering my intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts, allowing for a more sustainable approach to hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with the number of wolves still high, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and scarcity. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while waiting for a more favorable situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious not to overexert myself, as the competition among wolves is still high. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the wolf population is still high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves for the limited prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself, which is crucial for survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition from other wolves. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt aggressively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep, I need to balance my energy expenditure and increase my chances of survival. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With fewer sheep available, a lower intensity will conserve energy and reduce competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics and increases my chances of survival without risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the recent decrease in the wolf population suggests competition for food is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",

            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, allowing me to survive longer in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in the wolf population suggests increased competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring I have enough energy to survive while still contributing to the pack"
