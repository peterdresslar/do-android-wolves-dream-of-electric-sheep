            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves in the area, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching enough sheep while still being mindful of the risks associated with overexertion in a crowded hunting environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a tougher hunting environment. By increasing my intensity to 0.75, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival as the competition among wolves is rising.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help me conserve energy and avoid competition while still allowing me to hunt effectively when necessary.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion without guaranteeing a successful hunt. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, adapting to the current situation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure in securing a meal. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and wait for a better opportunity while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid overexertion, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with a recent decline in their population. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity of prey and the increased competition."
