            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for me. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition, increasing my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance my energy expenditure while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This way, I can ensure my survival without exhausting myself or drawing too much attention from other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. Hunting at a lower intensity will help conserve energy and resources, allowing me to adapt to the changing environment and avoid competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By adjusting my hunting intensity to a moderate level, I can conserve energy while still being competitive with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy and reduce competition for the remaining sheep. This strategy allows me to survive longer while waiting for better opportunities.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still catch enough prey without exhausting myself or attracting too much competition. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.75, I can maximize my chances of securing enough food while still being mindful of the competition with other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of prey. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still participating in the hunt. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and avoid overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at full intensity may not yield enough food. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in a competitive environment."
