            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food more scarce. With more wolves around, I need to increase my hunting intensity to compete effectively for the limited resources. A theta of 0.65 allows me to balance the need for food while conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population suggests more competition for food. By raising my hunting intensity slightly, I can better secure my share of the dwindling sheep population while still being mindful of the risks involved in overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This strategy increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself in a dwindling population of prey. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high due to their recent decline. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to catch enough food to survive. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and the competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment."
