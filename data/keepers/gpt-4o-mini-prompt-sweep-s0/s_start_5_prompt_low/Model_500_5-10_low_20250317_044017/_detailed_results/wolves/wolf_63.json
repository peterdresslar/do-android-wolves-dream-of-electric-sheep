            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, indicating a scarcity of food. With more wolves competing for the same limited resources, a lower hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid direct competition with others. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can maximize my chances of catching enough food while still being cautious, as the increase in the wolf population means competition is higher. This balance helps ensure my survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By lowering my intensity to 0.30, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who are likely to hunt aggressively. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a dwindling environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to catch enough food to survive. A lower theta also reduces the risk of overexertion in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can improve my chances of securing food without overexerting myself, which is crucial given the declining wolf population. A moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity while still being cautious.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers dropping as well. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being proactive in securing food. This balance increases my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival without overexerting myself."
