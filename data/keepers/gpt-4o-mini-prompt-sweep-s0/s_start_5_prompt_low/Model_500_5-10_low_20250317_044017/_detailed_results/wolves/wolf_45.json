            "I chose this theta because the increase in the wolf population means competition for food is rising. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure enough food while conserving energy and avoiding overexertion. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics of the pack and the declining sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, while the wolf population has increased. Hunting at a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. By choosing a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the hunt, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means there are fewer prey available. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and reduce my chances of securing food. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, increasing my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable at maximum intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity slightly to 0.40, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy, given the recent decline in both sheep and wolf populations. This balance is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their population also declining. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, a moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective.
