            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, indicating a potential scarcity of food. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, ensuring my survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, and the number of wolves has increased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when necessary. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making food scarcer. With an increase in the wolf population, competition for food will be higher. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.65, I can improve my chances of successfully catching prey while still conserving some energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and avoid competition while still contributing to the pack's success. This balance increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.60, I can improve my chances of catching prey while still conserving energy for future hunts. This balance is crucial for my survival in a competitive environment with increasing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in hunts, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, which means hunting at maximum intensity may not be necessary and could lead to overexploitation. By increasing my intensity slightly from my previous theta, I can still contribute to the hunt while ensuring sustainability for future needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making hunting more challenging. By adjusting my hunting intensity to 0.5, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a competitive environment with fewer resources."
