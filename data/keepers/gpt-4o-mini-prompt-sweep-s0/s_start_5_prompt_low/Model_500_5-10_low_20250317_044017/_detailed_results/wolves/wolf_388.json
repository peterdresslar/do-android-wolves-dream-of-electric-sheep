            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With an increase in the wolf population, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and potential failure. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in hunting, balancing the need for food with the risks of overexertion.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, which means competition for food will be higher among wolves. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.70, I can improve my chances of securing enough food while still being cautious about overexerting myself in a potentially scarce environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overexploitation of the remaining sheep. By reducing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can conserve energy and increase my chances of survival while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a challenging environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as other wolves may also be competing for the limited sheep. This moderate approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and improve my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is relatively low compared to the number of wolves, indicating fierce competition for food. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion and potential injury. This way, I can still contribute to my survival while being mindful of the dwindling resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition with other wolves for limited resources. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid unnecessary confrontations, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, and the number of wolves has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's survival. This balance allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself or risking depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the competition among wolves has increased with their recent decrease. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still contributing to the pack's efforts.
