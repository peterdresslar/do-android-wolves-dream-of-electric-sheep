            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and the increase in wolves means competition for food is higher. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still being able to hunt effectively when the opportunity arises.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less rewarding. With more wolves around, a lower intensity will help conserve energy while still allowing for some hunting. This balance increases my chances of survival in a competitive environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still find enough food while avoiding overexertion. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows me to adapt to the changing environment and still compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, and with fewer sheep available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the declining prey availability while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to wasted energy and increased competition with other wolves. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being able to hunt effectively when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and the competition among wolves is high with their numbers also dropping. A moderate hunting intensity allows me to conserve energy while still being effective in securing food, balancing the need for survival with the current scarcity.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the current scarcity while still participating in the hunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased, making hunting more challenging. By increasing my intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of competing with other wolves, who are also hunting at maximum intensity. This way, I can still be effective without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, and with fewer prey available, hunting at maximum intensity may not be sustainable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting aggressively. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and increase my chances of survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need to secure food while still conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current situation without overexerting myself, which is crucial for my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low, and the wolf population has decreased significantly. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy while still increasing my chances of catching prey without overexerting myself or risking failure against other wolves. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves has increased due to their recent decline. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while still contributing to the pack's survival. This cautious approach allows me to adapt to the current situation and increases my chances of survival in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep is low and the competition among wolves is high. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid direct competition with other wolves, increasing my chances of survival in this challenging environment.",
