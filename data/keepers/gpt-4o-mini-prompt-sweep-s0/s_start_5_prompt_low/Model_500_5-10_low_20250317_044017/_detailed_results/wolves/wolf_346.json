            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and less food for everyone. By lowering my intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid attracting too much attention from other wolves while still contributing to the hunt when opportunities arise.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making them a scarcer resource. With an increase in the wolf population, I need to balance my hunting intensity to ensure I can still secure enough food without exhausting my energy. A moderate intensity of 0.50 allows me to be competitive while conserving energy for future hunts.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making hunting less viable. With more wolves around, competition for food will be fierce. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid overexertion while waiting for a better opportunity to hunt when the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexertion. This way, I can still hunt effectively while conserving energy for future hunts, especially with the rising number of wolves competing for the same resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population has decreased significantly, making food scarcer. With more wolves around, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and overhunting, risking starvation. A lower intensity allows me to conserve energy and adapt to the changing environment while still contributing to the pack",
            "I chose this theta because the decrease in both sheep and wolves indicates a more competitive environment. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while conserving energy, as the sheep population is low. This approach allows me to adapt to the current scarcity and avoid overexertion, ensuring my survival.",
