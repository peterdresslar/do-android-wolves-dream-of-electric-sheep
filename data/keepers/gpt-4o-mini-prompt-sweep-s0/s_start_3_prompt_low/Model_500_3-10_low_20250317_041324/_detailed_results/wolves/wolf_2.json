By reducing my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid drawing attention to myself, while still being able to hunt effectively if the opportunity arises. This balance helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves who may be hunting at maximum intensity. This strategy allows me to adapt to the current situation and ensure my survival while still contributing to the pack's overall success.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By increasing my hunting intensity to 0.50, I can balance the need for food while being cautious of competition from other wolves. This approach allows me to secure enough resources without overexerting myself, considering the recent decline in my pack."
