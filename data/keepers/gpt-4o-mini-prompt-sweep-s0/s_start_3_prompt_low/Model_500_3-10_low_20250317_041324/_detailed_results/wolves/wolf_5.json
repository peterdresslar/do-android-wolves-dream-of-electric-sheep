            "I chose this theta because with a low number of sheep relative to wolves, hunting at maximum intensity could lead to competition and exhaustion. A moderate intensity allows me to conserve energy while still participating in the hunt, increasing my chances of survival without overexerting myself.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, but the wolf population has decreased. This suggests that competition for food is less intense, allowing me to hunt with a lower intensity while still being effective. A theta of 0.45 balances the need for food with the risk of overexertion, ensuring my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because with the decrease in the wolf population, I need to be more aggressive in hunting to secure enough food for survival. The increase in sheep numbers suggests that there is an opportunity to hunt effectively, and a higher intensity will help me compete better against the remaining wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This balance helps ensure my survival in a changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a lower intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy increases my chances of survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, a moderate intensity allows me to secure food while also conserving energy for future hunts, ensuring my survival in a fluctuating environment."
