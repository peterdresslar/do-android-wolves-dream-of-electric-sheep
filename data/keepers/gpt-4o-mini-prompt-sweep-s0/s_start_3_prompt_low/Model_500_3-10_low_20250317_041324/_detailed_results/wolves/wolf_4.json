This suggests that hunting at a lower intensity may allow me to conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves, while still taking advantage of the available prey. A moderate approach will help ensure my survival in this changing environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased slightly, and the wolf population has decreased. By hunting at a moderate intensity, I can balance the need for food with the risk of overexerting myself and competing with other wolves. This approach allows me to adapt to the changing dynamics while still ensuring my survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, but the wolf population has decreased. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can conserve energy and avoid competition with other wolves while still taking advantage of the available prey. This strategy helps ensure my survival in a challenging environment.",
            "I chose this theta because the number of sheep has increased, providing a better opportunity for hunting without overexerting myself. With fewer wolves around, I can afford to be more aggressive in my hunting strategy while still being cautious, ensuring I have enough energy for future hunts."
