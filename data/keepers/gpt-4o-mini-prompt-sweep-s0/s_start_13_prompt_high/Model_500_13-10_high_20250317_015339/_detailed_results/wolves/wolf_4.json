By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also ensuring the wolf population does not decline too rapidly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and prioritizes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
