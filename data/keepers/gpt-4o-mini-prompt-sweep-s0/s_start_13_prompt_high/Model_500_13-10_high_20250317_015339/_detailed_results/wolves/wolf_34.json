This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival and a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 27.7% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 27.6% of maximum capacity, and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, we can allow the sheep population to stabilize while ensuring our own long-term survival."
