            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 95.30, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta allows us to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to maintain our numbers. This balance is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensures our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to give sheep a chance to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
