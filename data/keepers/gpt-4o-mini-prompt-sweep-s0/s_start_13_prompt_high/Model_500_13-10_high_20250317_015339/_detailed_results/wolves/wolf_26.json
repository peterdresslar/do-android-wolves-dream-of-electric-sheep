            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring the long-term survival of both. By adjusting theta gradually, I can respond to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that while the sheep population is still relatively healthy, the wolf population is moderately high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on maintaining our own numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. This approach helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
