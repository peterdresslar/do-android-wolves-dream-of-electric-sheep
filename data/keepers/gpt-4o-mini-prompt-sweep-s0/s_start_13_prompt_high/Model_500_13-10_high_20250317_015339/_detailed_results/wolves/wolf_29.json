            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep population is recovering but still below maximum capacity. A lower theta will allow us to focus on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for better competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability without risking immediate depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is prudent to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low compared to the maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase will help balance the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
