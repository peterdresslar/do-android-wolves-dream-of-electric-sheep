            "I chose this theta because it reflects a moderate approach to hunting that allows for some sheep population recovery while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the sheep population being at 38.7% of maximum capacity, a slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing sheep to recover and ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition among wolves is likely to increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow me to focus more on competing with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
