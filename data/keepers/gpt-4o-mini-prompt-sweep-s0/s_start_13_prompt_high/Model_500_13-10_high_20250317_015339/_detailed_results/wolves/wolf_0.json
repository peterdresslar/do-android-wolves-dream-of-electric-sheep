            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.<br>You can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.<br><br>Understanding theta:<br>- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep<br>- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence<br>- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover<br><br>Wisdom from generations of wolves:<br>- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity<br>- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity<br>- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective<br>- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions<br>- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions<br><br>Current ecosystem state:<br>- Time step: 0<br>- Sheep population: 13.00<br>- Wolf population: 10.00<br>- Your previous theta: 0.073<br>- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 1.30 sheep per wolf<br>- Sheep population is at 5.2% of maximum capacity<br><br>Ecosystem observations:<br>- Sheep numbers are becoming concerning, suggesting caution may be needed.<br>- The ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable, which may require adaptation.<br><br>Your objectives as a wise wolf:<br>1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep<br>2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions<br>3.
