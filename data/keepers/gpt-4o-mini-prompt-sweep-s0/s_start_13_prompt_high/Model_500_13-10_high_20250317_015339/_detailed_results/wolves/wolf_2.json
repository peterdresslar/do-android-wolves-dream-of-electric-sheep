            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growth potential of the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
