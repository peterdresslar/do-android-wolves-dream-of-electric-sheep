            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting. This approach helps to stabilize the ecosystem and gives sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. With the wolf population also being relatively low, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and while I need to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. With the wolf population being relatively low, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves rather than depleting the sheep further. This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, with a relatively low wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support our growth without depleting the sheep further. This moderate adjustment aims to maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution. With the wolf population also relatively low, it is important to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow their numbers to recover. However, with a relatively low wolf population, a slight increase in hunting intensity can support our growth without depleting the sheep too quickly. This moderate adjustment aims to maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low and concerning, which suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. With the wolf population also relatively low, focusing on competition rather than intense hunting will help stabilize both populations and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and concerning, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the gradual growth of the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the health of the ecosystem."
