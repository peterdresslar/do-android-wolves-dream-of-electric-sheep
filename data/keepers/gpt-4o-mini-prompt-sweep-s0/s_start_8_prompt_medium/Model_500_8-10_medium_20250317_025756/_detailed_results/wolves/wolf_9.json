A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving the sheep population a chance to recover. This strategy aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.96, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.23, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their long-term survival. This adjustment also considers the growing wolf population, ensuring we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.22, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.16, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.91, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to gradually increase hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.87, which is only 20.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both populations while still being mindful of the need to gradually increase hunting intensity as the sheep population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity.
