            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.00, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 10.00, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.43, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.20 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the necessity of sheep population recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.96, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations."
