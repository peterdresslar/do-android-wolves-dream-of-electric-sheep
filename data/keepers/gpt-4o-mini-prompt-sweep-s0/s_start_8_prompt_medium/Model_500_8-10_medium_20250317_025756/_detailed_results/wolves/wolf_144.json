            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the survival of my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help reduce pressure on the sheep, allowing for a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, which would jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.51, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolf population sustainability while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows me to focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a small increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between my pack",
