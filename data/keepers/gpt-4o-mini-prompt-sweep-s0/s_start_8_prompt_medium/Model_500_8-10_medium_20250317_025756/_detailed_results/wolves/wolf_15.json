This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting, a gradual approach is best.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a significant depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 24, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to depletion of sheep and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of sheep. A moderate approach will allow us to adapt to future changes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 63, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance."
