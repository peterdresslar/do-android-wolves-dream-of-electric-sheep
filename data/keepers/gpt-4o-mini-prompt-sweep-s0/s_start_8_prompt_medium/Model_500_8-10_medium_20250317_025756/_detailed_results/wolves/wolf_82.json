            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our wolf pack remains healthy in the long term. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further."
