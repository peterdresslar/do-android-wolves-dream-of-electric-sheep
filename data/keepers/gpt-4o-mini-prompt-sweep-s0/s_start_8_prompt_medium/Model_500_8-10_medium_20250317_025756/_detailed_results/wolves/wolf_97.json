            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 152.54, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight increase in theta will help maintain balance without risking overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective for hunting, it is important to gradually reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing for sheep recovery, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta will still allow for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was too focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to reduce my hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to support my pack. This gradual adjustment will help the sheep recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population."
