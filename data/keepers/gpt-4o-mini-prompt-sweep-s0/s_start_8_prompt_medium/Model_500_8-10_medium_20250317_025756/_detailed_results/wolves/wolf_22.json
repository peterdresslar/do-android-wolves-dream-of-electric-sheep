            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 86.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that while there is a healthy number of sheep, we must be cautious not to overhunt. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 14.49, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to recover slightly. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep and to sustain a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there is enough food available for my pack. However, to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the sheep can recover and maintain their population. This moderate adjustment reflects the need for balance as both populations are interconnected.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate increase to 0.55 balances our need for sustenance with the goal of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem."
