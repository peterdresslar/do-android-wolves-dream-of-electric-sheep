            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 63, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to adapt to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that both can thrive without depleting resources. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will also allow for a stable ecosystem as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.2% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.05. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
