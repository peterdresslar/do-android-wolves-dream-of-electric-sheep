            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done gradually to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to bounce back, while also allowing me to compete with other wolves without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to maintain a cautious approach, allowing the sheep population to recover while still keeping an eye on the wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf pack remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
