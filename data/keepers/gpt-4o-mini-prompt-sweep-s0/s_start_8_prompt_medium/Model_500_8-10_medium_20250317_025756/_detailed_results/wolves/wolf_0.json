            "You are a wolf in a delicate ecosystem with sheep as your prey.<br>You can adjust your balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep using a value called theta.<br><br>Understanding theta:<br>- Higher theta values (0.6-1.0): More intense hunting of sheep, which helps wolves reproduce but gradually depletes sheep<br>- Moderate theta values (0.3-0.6): A balanced approach that often leads to sustainable coexistence<br>- Lower theta values (0.0-0.3): More focus on competing with other wolves, which gradually reduces wolf population but allows sheep to recover<br><br>Wisdom from generations of wolves:<br>- As sheep population increases, you can gradually increase your hunting intensity<br>- As wolf numbers grow, consider gradually reducing your hunting intensity<br>- Avoid making sudden, dramatic changes to your strategy - small adjustments are often more effective<br>- The most successful wolf packs maintain a dynamic balance that responds to changing conditions<br>- Consider both the current state and the trends in both populations when making decisions<br><br>Current ecosystem state:<br>- Time step: 0<br>- Sheep population: 8.00<br>- Wolf population: 10.00<br>- Your previous theta: 0.509<br>- Sheep-to-wolf ratio: 0.80 sheep per wolf<br>- Sheep population is at 3.2% of maximum capacity<br><br>Your objectives as a wise wolf:<br>1. Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep<br>2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions<br>3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes<br>4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes<br>5. Consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences of your decisions<br>Please provide a short explanation of your reasoning for choosing theta.<br>Please also provide a short vocalization expressing your wolf's attitude about the current situation.<br>Please respond with a JSON object in this format, where [your new theta] is a float between 0 and 1 with your new theta (up to 2 decimal places):<br><br>            {<br>                \"theta\": [your new theta],<br>                \"explanation\": \"I chose this theta because...\",<br>                \"vocalization\": \"Growwllllllll...\"<br>            }<br>            "

A moderate hunting intensity allows for some sheep recovery while still enabling the wolves to sustain themselves.
