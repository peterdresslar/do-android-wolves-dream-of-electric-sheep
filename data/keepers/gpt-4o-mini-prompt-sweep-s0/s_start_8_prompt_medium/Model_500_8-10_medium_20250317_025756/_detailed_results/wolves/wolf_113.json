            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate increase will help maintain balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.70 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain hunting intensity while also considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep without depleting the sheep population further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still being cautious not to over-deplete them. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting while maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 0.03, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
