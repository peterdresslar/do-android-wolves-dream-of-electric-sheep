            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is already relatively high. This adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.03. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase in number, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a critical need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to grow, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can begin to take advantage of any potential recovery in the sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This approach allows for a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
