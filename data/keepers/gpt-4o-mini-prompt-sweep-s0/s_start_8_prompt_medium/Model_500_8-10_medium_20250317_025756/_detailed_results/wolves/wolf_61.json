            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help maintain a balance. This approach will support the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive, preventing overhunting and potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our own survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help prevent further depletion of the sheep, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of our pack."
