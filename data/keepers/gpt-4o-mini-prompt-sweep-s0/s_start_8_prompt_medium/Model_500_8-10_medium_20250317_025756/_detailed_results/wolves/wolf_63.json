        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep to support moderate hunting. This adjustment allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance. It also considers the need to avoid over-depletion of the sheep population as the wolf numbers are relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also addressing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and supports long-term sustainability for both species."
