            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, given the low previous theta and the need to gradually adjust, a moderate increase to 0.25 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while ensuring that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant at 96, which suggests that a moderate approach is necessary to prevent overhunting while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting intensity and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between our wolf population and the sheep, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem."
