            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.43, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and creating a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.96, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.23, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.81, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
