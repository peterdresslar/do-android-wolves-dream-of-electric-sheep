            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 77.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase in theta will also allow us to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. It allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains healthy without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 63, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment is gradual, reflecting the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring long-term survival for both species."
