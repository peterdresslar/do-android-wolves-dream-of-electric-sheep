        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.05, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term survival for both species. A lower theta will allow for reduced hunting pressure, giving sheep a chance to rebound while also addressing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.26, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing hunting intensity. This will allow the sheep to rebound while also preventing overcompetition among wolves."
