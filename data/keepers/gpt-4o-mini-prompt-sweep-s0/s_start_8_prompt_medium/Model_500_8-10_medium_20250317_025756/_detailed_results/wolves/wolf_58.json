            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.11, a slight increase in hunting will support our needs without risking the sheep population too severely.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 61.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover without being overly depleted. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, as the wolf population is relatively high, and I want to avoid over-depleting the sheep while ensuring our pack remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
