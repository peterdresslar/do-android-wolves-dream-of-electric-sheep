            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to adapt to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 24, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity to promote sustainability. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 152.54, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 96.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
