            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 216.58, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and aims for a balanced coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population growth while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population."
