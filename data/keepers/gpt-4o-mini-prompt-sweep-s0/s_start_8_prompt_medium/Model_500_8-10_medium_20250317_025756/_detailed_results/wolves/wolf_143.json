            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to maintain a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, promoting a gradual recovery of the sheep population and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize our own population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This way, I can ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 0.04, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting the recovery of sheep while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a collapse of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.03. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.51, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.45, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.04, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while keeping the wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already at a lower level. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.41, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
