            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a wolf population of 137, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting, allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. A gradual increase in theta will allow me to monitor the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing my pack to compete effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 indicates a focus on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity, I will increase theta to 0.30. This adjustment promotes a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
