            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially as the wolf population is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase in numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.05. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase their numbers while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.26, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 100, a slight increase in theta to 0.35 allows for a modest focus on hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance and sustainability of both populations."
