            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overhunted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 96, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
