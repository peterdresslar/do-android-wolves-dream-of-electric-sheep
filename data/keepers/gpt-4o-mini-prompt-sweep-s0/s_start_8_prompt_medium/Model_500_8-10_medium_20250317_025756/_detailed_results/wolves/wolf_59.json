            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains stable. A theta of 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep and avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that both can thrive without depleting resources. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for adaptation to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 159. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to grow, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
