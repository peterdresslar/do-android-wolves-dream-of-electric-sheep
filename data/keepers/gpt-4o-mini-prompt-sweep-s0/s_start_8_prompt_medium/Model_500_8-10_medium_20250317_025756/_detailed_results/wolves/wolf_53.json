            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of their numbers. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 61.0% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was focused on hunting, I need to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.55 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while also considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, a moderate hunting intensity is necessary. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
