            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and sustain itself. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, especially with the wolf population being low.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This value reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 72.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with only 4 wolves, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high, suggesting that I should not over-hunt to ensure the sustainability of both populations. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 77.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf numbers while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. It is important to avoid overhunting at this stage to prevent future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase to 0.55 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A slight reduction from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to ensure that we maintain a sustainable balance. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling our pack to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf pack. This adjustment is gradual and aligns with the wisdom of responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive together while also considering the recent growth in wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
