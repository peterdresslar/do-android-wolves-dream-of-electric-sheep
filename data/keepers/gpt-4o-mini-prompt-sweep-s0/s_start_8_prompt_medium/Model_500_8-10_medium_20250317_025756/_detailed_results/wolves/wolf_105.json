            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A theta of 0.75 allows for increased hunting intensity while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity of 0.60 strikes a balance between ensuring enough food for my pack and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.26, which is just 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for a balanced approach that supports coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and prevents further depletion, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. Given the current high wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves. This adjustment supports the recovery of the sheep population without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
