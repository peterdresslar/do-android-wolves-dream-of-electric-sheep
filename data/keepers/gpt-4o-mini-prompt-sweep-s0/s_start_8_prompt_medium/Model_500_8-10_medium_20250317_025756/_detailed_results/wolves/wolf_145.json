            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A balanced approach is essential to maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will reduce hunting intensity and help stabilize the ecosystem, preventing a crash in the sheep population while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.26, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.03. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep population to recover. Gradually increasing theta from my previous value of 0.20 allows for a cautious approach to balance competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring our pack does not overhunt and deplete the remaining sheep. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
