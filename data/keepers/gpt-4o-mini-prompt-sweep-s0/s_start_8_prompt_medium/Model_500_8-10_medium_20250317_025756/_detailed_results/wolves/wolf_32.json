            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep and to promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring the long-term survival of both. Additionally, with the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 63, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant at 96, which suggests that I should avoid over-hunting to maintain balance. A moderate increase in theta allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep and promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring that our pack remains strong while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back."
