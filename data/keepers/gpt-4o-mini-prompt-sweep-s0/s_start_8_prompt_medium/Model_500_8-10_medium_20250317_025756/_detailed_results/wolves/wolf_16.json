            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. It reflects a cautious strategy, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain balance as the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and it prevents overhunting that could lead to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some competition among wolves. A gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly, fostering a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the fact that the sheep population is at 61% of its maximum capacity, a theta of 0.55 allows for a cautious approach that promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to ensure long-term survival and stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without drastic competition."
