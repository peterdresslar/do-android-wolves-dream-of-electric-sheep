            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a wolf population of 137, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.3 will help us compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a small increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.03. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.76, which is only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
