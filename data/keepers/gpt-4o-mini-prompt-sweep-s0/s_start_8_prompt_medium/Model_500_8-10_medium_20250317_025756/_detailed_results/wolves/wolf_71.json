        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring our pack can thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.25 to 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain the wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem."
