            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 61% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.4 to 0.35, I can still engage in hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance as the sheep population begins to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in sheep numbers, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to adapt to the current conditions while still being cautious about the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting and ensuring our long-term survival. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance.",
