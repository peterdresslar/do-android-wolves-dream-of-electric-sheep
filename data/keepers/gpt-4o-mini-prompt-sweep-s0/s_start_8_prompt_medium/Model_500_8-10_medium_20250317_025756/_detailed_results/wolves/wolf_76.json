            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This value helps maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growth of our own numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to over-deplete the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious to avoid over-depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the need for sustainable coexistence."
