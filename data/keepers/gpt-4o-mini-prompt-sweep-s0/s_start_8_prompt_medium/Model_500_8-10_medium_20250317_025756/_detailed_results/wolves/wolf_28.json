            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual approach is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to adapt to the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, given the wolf population is also significant, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the wolf population sustainably."
