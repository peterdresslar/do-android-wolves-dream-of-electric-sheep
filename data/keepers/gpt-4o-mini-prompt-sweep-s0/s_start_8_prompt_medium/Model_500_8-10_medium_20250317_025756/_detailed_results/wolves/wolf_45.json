            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and my previous theta was very low. Gradually increasing my hunting intensity will allow for a sustainable balance while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.450 was a balanced approach, I believe a slight reduction to 0.40 will allow for a more cautious strategy that focuses on competing with other wolves while still permitting some hunting. This will help ensure the sheep can recover without depleting their numbers further, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, helping to stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
