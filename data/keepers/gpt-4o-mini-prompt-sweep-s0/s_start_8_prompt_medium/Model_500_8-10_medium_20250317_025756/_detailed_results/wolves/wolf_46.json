            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of sheep. This value reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 96, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the sheep population can recover while wolves remain healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population."
