            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain wolf health. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem, preventing a potential crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.35, allowing for a slight increase in sheep hunting while still being cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a severe depletion of sheep, which would jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also addressing the immediate need for sheep population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.51, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.45, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases their population, ensuring a sustainable food source for the future. Additionally, with a wolf population of 39, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize our numbers and avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help me compete with other wolves while still being cautious about depleting the sheep further."
