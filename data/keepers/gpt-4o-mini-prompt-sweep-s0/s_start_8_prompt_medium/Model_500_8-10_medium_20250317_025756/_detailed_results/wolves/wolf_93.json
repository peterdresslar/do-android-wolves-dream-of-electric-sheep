        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also significant. A lower theta allows for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a sudden decline in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in sheep numbers. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe depletion of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is very low, and my previous theta was already focused on competition with other wolves. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem, a slight increase to 0.30 will help balance my focus on competition and hunting without overwhelming the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep."
