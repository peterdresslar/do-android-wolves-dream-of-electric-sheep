            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.620 indicates a focus on hunting, I need to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.45 reflects a moderate hunting intensity that can help maintain the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This approach will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on competition rather than hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the sheep population while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and avoids the risk of depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
