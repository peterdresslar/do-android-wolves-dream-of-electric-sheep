            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. Increasing my hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.26, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and grow, ensuring a sustainable food source for the future. Additionally, with a high wolf population of 100, focusing on competition among wolves rather than hunting will help stabilize our numbers and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. Gradual adjustments are key, so a slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing competition with other wolves and allowing for some hunting without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.61, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach that balances competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. It is important to avoid overhunting at this critical time to ensure the long-term survival of both species."
