            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 77.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This adjustment reflects a slight decrease from my previous theta, acknowledging the growing wolf population while still allowing for some hunting to ensure our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while still allowing for some growth in our numbers. A gradual increase in hunting will support our needs without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta of 0.550 was balanced, a slight reduction to 0.45 allows for a more cautious approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still permitting some hunting to sustain my pack. This adjustment reflects the need for a dynamic balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our pack."
