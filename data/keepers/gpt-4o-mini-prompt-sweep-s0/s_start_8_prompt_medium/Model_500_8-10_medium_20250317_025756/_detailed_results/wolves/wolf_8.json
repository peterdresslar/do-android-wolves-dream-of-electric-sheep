            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.00, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively. A moderate theta of 0.4 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.96, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.23, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.81, which is only 4.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.75, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.81, which is only 5.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.92, which is only 6.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance, ensuring both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.1% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both sheep and wolves. This value reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.16, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.91, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.83, which is only 9.1% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.90, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.17, which is only 10.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.67, which is only 11.9% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.36, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.
