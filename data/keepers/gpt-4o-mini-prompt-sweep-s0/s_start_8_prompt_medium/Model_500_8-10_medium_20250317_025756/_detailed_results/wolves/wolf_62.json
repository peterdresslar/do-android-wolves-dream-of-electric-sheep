            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 78.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low, and the wolf population is relatively stable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves. This moderate increase allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 96, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover, while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting the sheep further if we continue to hunt aggressively. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring our own population remains stable. This gradual adjustment allows for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was already low at 0.25. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity, I will increase theta slightly to 0.30. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both species and aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes."
