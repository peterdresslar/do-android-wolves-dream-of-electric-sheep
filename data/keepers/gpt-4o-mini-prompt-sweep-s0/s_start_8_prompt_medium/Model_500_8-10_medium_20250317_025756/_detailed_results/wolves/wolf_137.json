            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.45, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help stabilize the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while preventing overexploitation of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance while avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.04, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach that balances the need for wolf competition while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensively would further deplete the sheep, jeopardizing long-term survival. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at a critical point for sustainability. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population recover while also allowing our wolf pack to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition among wolves. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing sheep to regain their numbers, while also considering the growing wolf population."
