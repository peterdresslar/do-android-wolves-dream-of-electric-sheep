            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, I need to be cautious and avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the overall balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By adopting a moderate theta of 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
