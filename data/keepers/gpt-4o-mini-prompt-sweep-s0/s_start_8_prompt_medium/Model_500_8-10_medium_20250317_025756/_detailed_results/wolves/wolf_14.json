            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 77.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious response to the growing wolf population, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 221.85, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 86.6% of maximum capacity and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. Gradually adjusting from my previous theta of 0.50 allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I want to avoid overhunting that could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it is wise to adopt a moderate approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This theta value reflects a balance that promotes coexistence and gradual adaptation to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balance that can help sustain both populations while avoiding overhunting."
