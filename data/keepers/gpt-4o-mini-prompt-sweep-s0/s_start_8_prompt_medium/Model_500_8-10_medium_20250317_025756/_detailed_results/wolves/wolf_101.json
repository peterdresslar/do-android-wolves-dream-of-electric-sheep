        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment reflects the need to balance competition with other wolves and the availability of prey, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports my pack while still considering the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, thus promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring that we can sustain ourselves in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting, I will increase theta slightly to 0.30. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to help the wolf population thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. A small increase to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.04, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
