            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was very low, and with the wolf population at 96, I need to balance hunting with competition among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.3 allows for some hunting while still focusing on maintaining the wolf population and giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. By gradually increasing theta, I can support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting intensity without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population. This approach supports a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
