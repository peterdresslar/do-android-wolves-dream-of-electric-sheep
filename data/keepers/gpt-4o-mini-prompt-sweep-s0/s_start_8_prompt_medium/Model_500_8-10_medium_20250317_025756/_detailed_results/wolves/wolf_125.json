            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a wolf population of 137, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.25 to 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for cautious hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.26, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves for resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our numbers without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual approach allows for recovery of the sheep while still ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting."
