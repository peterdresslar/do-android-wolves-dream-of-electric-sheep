By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity that can help sustain my pack while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",

This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline and jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
