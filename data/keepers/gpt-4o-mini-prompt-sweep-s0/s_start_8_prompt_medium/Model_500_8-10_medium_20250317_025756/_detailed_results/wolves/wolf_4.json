            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential risk for overhunting. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that the sheep have a chance to recover while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves. This balance will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.43, which is only 3.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.96, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach that balances competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.23, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep availability. However, I must be cautious and avoid overhunting, so I will make a small adjustment to 0.40 to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves."
