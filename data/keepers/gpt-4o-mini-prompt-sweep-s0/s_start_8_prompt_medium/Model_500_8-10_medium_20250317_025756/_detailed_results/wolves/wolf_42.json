            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also considering the current wolf population and the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as it allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 34.5% of maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both wolf and sheep populations remain stable. This adjustment allows for gradual increases in hunting as the sheep population grows while also considering the current wolf population, which is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need some time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves to stabilize our population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep."
