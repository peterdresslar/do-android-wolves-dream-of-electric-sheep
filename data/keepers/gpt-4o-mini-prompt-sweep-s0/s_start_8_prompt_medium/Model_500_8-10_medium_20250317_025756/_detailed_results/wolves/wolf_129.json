            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.620 was effective for hunting, it may be too intense given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.21. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, promoting a healthier ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.47, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Given the high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.03. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in the sheep population, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually, maintaining a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.03. Maintaining a lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. Sudden increases in hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the survival of the sheep, which is crucial for the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of my pack. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
