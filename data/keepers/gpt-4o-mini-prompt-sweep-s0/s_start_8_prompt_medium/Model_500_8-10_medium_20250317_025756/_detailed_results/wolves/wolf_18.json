            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring sustainable coexistence. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 96, it is wise to avoid overhunting to ensure our numbers remain healthy. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack remains healthy. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
