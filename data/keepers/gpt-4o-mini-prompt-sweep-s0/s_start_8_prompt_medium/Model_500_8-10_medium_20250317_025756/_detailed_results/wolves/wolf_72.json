            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value reflects a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while still maintaining a moderate approach to competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach allows for gradual adaptation to the changing conditions while promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while preventing a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
