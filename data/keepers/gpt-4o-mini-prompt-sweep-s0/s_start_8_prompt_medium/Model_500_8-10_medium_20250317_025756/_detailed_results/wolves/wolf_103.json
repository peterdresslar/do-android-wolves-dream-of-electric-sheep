            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. My previous theta was quite low, and while I need to focus on competition with other wolves, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.26, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 100, I need to ensure that we do not compete too aggressively with each other. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.03, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
