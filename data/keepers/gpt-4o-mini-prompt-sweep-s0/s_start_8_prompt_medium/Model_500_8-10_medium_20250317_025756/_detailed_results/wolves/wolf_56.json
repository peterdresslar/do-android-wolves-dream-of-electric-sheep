        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 195.67, which allows for some increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, I want to avoid overhunting, so I am making a moderate adjustment from my previous theta of 0.984 to ensure sustainable coexistence and allow for gradual recovery if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure sustainable coexistence and avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a moderate hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also allowing for some wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term survival for both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
