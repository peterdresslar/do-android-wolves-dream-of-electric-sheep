            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.59, there is still a significant number of sheep available for hunting. By setting theta at 0.3, I can focus on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance between both populations and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.47, which is only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolf population sustainability while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
