            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate increase in hunting will support reproduction while still allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a gradual balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting."
