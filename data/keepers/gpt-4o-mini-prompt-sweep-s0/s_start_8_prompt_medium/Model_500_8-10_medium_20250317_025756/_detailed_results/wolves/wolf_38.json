            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting, a balanced approach will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent given the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has a chance to stabilize and grow, promoting long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and while I need to ensure my own survival and that of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem."
