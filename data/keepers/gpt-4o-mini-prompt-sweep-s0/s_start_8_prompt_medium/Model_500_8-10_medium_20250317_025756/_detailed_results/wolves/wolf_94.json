This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is important to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure, giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. Increasing it slightly allows for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
