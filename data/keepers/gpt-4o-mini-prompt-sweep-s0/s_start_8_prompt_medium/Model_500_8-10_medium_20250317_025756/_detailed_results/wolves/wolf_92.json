            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual approach will help prevent a crash in both populations."
