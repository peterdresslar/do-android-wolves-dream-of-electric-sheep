            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.00, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for some reproduction among wolves while not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.96, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.23, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable ecosystem while still keeping an eye on future hunting opportunities as the sheep population increases.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.99, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.75, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 4.00, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.81, which is only 5.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that encourages wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.92, which is only 6.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively low at 6.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.63, which is only 7.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves."
