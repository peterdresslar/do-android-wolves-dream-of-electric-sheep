            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain a sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is stable, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 63, I must be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still promoting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to ensure the long-term survival of both species, a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring that our wolf population remains stable. This gradual approach allows for a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
