        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A theta of 0.75 allows for a more intense hunting approach while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This suggests that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.26, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.03. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
