            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-exploitation of the sheep. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By setting theta to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.99, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on the competition with other wolves, ensuring that we do not over-exploit the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
