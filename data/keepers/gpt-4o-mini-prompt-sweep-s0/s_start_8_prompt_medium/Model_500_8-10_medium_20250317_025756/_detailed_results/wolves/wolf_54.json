            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A balanced approach at this stage will promote coexistence and prevent over-depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help achieve this balance without making sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.09. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.8% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that a more cautious approach is necessary. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on the sheep while allowing for some recovery. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population has a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
