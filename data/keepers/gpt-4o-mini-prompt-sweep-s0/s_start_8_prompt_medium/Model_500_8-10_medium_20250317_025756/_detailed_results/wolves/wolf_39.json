            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 78.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. It reflects a cautious strategy that adapts to the current conditions without risking overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach, considering both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current wolf population, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while still supporting our wolf pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without causing immediate harm to the sheep."
