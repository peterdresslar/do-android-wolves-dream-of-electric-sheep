This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. It\u2019s important to avoid drastic changes, so a gradual increase is the best approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 77.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This balance will help maintain both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 88.7% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a sustainable balance between the wolf and sheep populations while also considering the current growth of the wolf population. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly as we adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 39, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our reproduction.",

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing my needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
