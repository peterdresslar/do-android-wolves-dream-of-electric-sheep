            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 137, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.31, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.01, which is only 5.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.05. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.04, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.51, which is only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time."
