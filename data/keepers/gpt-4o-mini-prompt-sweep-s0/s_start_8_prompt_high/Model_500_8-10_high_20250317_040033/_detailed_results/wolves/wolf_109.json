            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A theta of 0.75 allows for a more intense hunting strategy while still being cautious and avoiding overexploitation, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population recovery while still enabling the wolf pack to sustain itself. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of both populations.",
