            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. The wolf population is low, and with a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, we can afford to hunt more aggressively to support our growth while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. The sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are many sheep available, and a slight increase in hunting will support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, suggesting that I should avoid over-hunting to prevent depletion of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing some sustenance for the pack. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
