            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is relatively high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely increasing. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help stabilize the ecosystem.",

A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing for some recovery of the sheep. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
