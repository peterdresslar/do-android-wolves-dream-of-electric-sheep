However, with a wolf population of 25, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",

This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term survival for both species.",

This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
