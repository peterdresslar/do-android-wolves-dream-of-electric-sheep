            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep population is at 43.0% of its maximum capacity. A theta of 0.3 allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting of sheep, promoting recovery in their population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Given the high wolf population, a gradual increase in hunting will also help prevent competition among wolves from becoming too intense.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition.

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
