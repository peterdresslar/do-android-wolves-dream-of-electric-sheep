However, the wolf population is relatively high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow me to maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",

However, the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves, giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",

A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and balance in the ecosystem.",
