            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, which suggests that increased competition could arise if hunting intensity is too high. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our numbers while giving sheep a chance to recover without depleting their population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
