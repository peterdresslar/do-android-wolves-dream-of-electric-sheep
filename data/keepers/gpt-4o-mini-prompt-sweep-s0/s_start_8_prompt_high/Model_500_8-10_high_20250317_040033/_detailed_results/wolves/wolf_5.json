A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach ensures the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also considering the growth potential of the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious of overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in our ecosystem. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep.
