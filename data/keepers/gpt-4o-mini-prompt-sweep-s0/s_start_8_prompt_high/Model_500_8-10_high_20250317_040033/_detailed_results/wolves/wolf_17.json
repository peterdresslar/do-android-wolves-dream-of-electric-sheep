            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can increase our hunting intensity without jeopardizing the long-term survival of either species. A gradual increase to 0.90 allows for more effective hunting while still considering the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can afford to reduce my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the sheep can recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and supports long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population recovery while still enabling wolves to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help balance our hunting intensity while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 34.0% of its maximum capacity, it is wise to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach aligns with the need to maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
