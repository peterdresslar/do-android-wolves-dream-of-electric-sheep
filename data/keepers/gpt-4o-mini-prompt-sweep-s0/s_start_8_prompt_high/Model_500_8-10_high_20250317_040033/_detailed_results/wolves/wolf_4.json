            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolf population to grow gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growth potential of our wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I need to be cautious to prevent further depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current low sheep numbers and the potential for wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
