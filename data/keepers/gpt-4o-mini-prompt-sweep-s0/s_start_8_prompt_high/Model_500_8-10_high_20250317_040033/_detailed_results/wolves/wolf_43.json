A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and prevents potential crashes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves, giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the need to balance both species for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
