A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to maintain the sheep population. This gradual adjustment supports both the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. A gradual adjustment is key to sustaining both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase aligns with the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to stabilize while also managing our own population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while also preventing overpopulation of wolves. This gradual adjustment supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover slightly. A small increase from my previous theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps avoid drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
