            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the wolf population being moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more balanced approach is necessary to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta will help ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a focus on competition while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 34.0% of maximum capacity, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being quite high, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining our own population health. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
