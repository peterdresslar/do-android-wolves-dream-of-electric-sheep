            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, given the high wolf population and the decreasing sheep-to-wolf ratio, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A moderate increase in theta will help maintain balance while still allowing for growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is relatively healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on reducing competition among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help prevent overhunting and promote long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among ourselves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover.
