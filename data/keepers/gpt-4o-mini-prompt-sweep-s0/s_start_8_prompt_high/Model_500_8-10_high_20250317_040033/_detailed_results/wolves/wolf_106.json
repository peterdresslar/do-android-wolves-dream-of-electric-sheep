A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the necessity of maintaining a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring a sustainable balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 28.0% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still considering the wolf population"
