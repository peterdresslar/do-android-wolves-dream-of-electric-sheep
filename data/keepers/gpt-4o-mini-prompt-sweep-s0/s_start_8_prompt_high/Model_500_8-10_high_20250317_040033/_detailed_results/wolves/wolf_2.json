By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while being mindful of the sheep",

With the wolf population also relatively low, a moderate approach allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of sheep. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
