This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. Given that the wolf population is moderately high, a slight increase in hunting will support reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep depletion while also reducing competition among wolves, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",

The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

With the sheep population at 30.4% of its maximum capacity, it is wise to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while managing competition. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
