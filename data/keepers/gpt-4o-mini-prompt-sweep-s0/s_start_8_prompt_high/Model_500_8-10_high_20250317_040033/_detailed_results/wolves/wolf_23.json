            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 18, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for the sheep to recover and the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for healthy reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the sustainability of both populations as the wolf numbers are moderately high.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 40.3% of its maximum capacity, a moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough sustenance for the wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance and avoids over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach, focusing on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
