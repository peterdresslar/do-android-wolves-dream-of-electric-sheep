            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that increased competition among wolves is likely. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still permitting some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population while addressing the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at 37.2% of its maximum capacity, a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling wolves to compete effectively. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep population at 34.0% of its maximum capacity, it is prudent to focus on reducing competition rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with the wolf population being relatively high, it is wise to focus on reducing competition among wolves. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. A gradual increase in theta is necessary, but caution is key to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This approach supports long-term sustainability and prevents overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing sheep to recover while preventing overexploitation. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low, and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming unfavorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. This moderate value helps ensure a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also being cautious about the growing wolf population. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden shifts in the ecosystem."
