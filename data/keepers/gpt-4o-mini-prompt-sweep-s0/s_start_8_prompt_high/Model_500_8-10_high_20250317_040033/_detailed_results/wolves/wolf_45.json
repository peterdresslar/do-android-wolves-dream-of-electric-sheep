            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that competition among wolves is increasing, and the sheep population is still recovering. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we manage our own numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. Given the high wolf population and the need to balance competition, a gradual increase in theta will support both immediate hunting needs and long-term ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. With the sheep population at a sustainable level, a moderate hunting intensity allows for coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
