A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help maintain the sheep population while also ensuring that the wolf population does not grow too rapidly. This moderate approach allows for a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
