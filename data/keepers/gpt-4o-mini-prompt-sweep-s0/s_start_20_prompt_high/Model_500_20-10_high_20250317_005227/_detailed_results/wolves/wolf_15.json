            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to take advantage of the abundant sheep while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. It allows for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A gradual increase will help maintain balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate approach will ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. With the wolf population also present, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is moderately high, and it allows for gradual adaptation to changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to ensure the wolves can thrive in the long term. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
