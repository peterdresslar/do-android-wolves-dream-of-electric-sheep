            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to capitalize on the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, since the wolf population is moderately high, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure that both populations can thrive. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough pressure to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and create a more sustainable balance.",
