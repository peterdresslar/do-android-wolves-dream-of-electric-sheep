            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover over time. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is moderately high, so a balanced approach is necessary to prevent over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.45 allows for gradual hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
