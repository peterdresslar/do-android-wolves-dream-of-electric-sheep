A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A gradual increase in hunting intensity is necessary to ensure the wolf population can thrive, but I must remain cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This small adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, a cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that both populations have the opportunity to stabilize and grow without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating a need for cautious hunting to prevent over-depletion. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, a slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and ensures that both populations can thrive."
