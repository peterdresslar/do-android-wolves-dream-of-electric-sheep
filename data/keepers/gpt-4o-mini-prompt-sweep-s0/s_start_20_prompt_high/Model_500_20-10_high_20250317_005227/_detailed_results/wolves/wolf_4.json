This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",

By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, I need to prioritize the recovery of sheep to ensure long-term sustainability. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some growth in the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while the wolf population is also low, it is important to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A small increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that can help stabilize both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while the wolf population is low, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.
