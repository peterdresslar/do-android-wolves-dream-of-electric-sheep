            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.6% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.08, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 36.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population being moderately high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our long-term survival. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance, allowing for some sheep depletion while still enabling recovery and coexistence. This gradual adjustment respects the wisdom of small changes and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
