            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also ensuring that our wolf pack remains healthy and sustainable in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly high, and while I want to ensure the wolf population can grow, I also need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term coexistence."
