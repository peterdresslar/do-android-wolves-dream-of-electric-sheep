            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the ratio of sheep to wolves is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
