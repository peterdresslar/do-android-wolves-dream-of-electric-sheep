        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment promotes wolf reproduction while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I need to be cautious to avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion or competition issues.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from 0.45 to 0.55, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, while also addressing the current high wolf population."
