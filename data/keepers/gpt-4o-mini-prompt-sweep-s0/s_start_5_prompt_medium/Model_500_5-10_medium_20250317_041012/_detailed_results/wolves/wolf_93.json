        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need for the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports the sheep's recovery without drastically reducing the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.03, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. Increasing my theta too much could lead to further depletion of the sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase to 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while ensuring the wolf pack does not overextend itself. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
