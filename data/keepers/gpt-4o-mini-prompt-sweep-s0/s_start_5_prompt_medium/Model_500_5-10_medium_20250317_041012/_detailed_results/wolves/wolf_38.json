            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 238.90, allowing for some continued hunting without risking a significant decline in their numbers. However, since the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a more sustainable approach while still enabling reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem as I adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to replenish while also reducing competition among wolves. A gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a small increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
