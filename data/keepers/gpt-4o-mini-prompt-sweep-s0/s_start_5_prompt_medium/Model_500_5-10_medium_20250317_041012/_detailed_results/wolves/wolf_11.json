            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 74.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, I must be cautious not to overhunt, as the wolf population is low and competition among wolves could become a concern. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 81% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover without being overly depleted. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the wolf and sheep populations. This adjustment balances the need for hunting with the importance of not depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for continued reproduction among wolves. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of making small changes to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
