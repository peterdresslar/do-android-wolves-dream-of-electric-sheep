            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep population while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term. This adjustment reflects the need to maintain a sustainable ecosystem while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance."
