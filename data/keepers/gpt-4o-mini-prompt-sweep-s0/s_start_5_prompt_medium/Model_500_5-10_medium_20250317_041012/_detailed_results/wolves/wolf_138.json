            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.800 was effective for hunting, I need to be cautious and allow the sheep population to recover. A slight reduction to 0.70 will still enable me to hunt effectively while promoting a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By adopting a moderate theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.200 was already focused on competition rather than hunting. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, enabling a gradual recovery of the sheep population while still considering the need for wolf survival. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
