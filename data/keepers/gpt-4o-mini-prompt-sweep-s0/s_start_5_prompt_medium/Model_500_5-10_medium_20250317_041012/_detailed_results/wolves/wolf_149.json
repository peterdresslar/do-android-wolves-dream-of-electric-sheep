            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 144, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.44, which is just 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep population while being mindful of the need for their recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and focuses on long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.84, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity, it could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.80, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing sheep to repopulate, ensuring long-term sustainability."
