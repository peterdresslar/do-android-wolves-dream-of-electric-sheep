            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. By maintaining a theta of 0.5, I can ensure that we continue to thrive without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 95, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is still relatively high, suggesting that a moderate approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.50 to 0.45, I can ensure sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it is wise to maintain a moderate approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
