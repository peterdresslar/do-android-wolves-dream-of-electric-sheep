            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring a sustainable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability while also allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for our survival."
