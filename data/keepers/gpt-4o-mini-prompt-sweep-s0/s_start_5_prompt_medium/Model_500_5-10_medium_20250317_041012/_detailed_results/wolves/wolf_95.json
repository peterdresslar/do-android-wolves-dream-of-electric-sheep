            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the needs of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
