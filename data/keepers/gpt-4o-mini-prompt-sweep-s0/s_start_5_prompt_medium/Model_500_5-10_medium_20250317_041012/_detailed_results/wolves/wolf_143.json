            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help the sheep population stabilize while also considering the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While the wolf population is relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting the sheep entirely if we continue to hunt aggressively. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack does not overhunt and face a potential crash. A gradual adjustment towards a lower hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.00, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent further depletion of the sheep, while also addressing the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By slightly increasing theta to 0.35, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.84, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
