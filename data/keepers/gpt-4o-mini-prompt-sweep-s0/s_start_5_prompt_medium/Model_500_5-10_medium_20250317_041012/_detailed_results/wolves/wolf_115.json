            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep and maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. With a high wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting, allowing the sheep to replenish while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain balance without causing sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the current wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
