            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 144, I must also be cautious to avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly, so a moderate increase to 0.60 allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a moderate approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of sheep."
