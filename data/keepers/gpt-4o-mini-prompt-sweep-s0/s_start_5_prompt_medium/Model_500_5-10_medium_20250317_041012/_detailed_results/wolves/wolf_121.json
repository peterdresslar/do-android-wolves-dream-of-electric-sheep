        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 144, a lower theta allows for competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for food with the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for sustenance. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between both populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep have a chance to rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that if I continue to hunt aggressively, I risk depleting the sheep population further, which could jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.29, which is only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity at this stage could lead to further depletion of the sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term sustainability. A slight increase to 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
