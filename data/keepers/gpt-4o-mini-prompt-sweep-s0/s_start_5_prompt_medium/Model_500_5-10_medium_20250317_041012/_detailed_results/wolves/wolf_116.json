            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This value allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A gradual decrease in hunting will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will help create a more sustainable ecosystem."
