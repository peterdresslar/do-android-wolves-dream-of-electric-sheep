            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.550 allowed for some hunting, I need to focus on ensuring the sheep can recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to promote sheep population growth while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual reduction in hunting intensity while still keeping an eye on the dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some sustainable hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. A moderate approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance."
