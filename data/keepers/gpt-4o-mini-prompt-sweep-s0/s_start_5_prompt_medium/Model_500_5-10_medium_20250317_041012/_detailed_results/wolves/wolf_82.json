            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. By setting theta at 0.3, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover slightly. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack but prioritizes competition with other wolves to prevent over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also keeping competition among wolves in check.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance and considers the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves at this lower theta, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
