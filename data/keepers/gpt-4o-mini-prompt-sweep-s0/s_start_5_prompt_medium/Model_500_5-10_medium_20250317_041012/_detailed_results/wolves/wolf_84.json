            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low at 0.244, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.3 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to hunt while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.03, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual approach is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, I can help allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem in the long run."
