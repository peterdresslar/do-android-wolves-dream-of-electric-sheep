            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 95, it is important to avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the wolf and sheep populations can thrive together while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize without risking a crash."
