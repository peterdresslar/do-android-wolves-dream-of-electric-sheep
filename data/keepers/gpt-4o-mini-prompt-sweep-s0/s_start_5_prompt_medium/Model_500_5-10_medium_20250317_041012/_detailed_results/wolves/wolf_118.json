            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it is important to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction, but it remains cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to bounce back. A moderate approach helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing hunting intensity. This will allow the sheep to rebound while also giving the wolf population time to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to current conditions without causing drastic changes."
