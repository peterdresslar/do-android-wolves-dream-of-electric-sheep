        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will support reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both wolf and sheep populations can thrive while also considering the recent growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. Increasing theta slightly allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack."
