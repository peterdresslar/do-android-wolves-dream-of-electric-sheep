            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting while ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself and the wolf population can remain healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting that allows for sustainable coexistence. The sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Additionally, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate theta will help maintain our numbers while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate approach, balancing the need to sustain my wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the long-term survival of both species."
