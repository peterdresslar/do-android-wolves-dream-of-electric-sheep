This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

Additionally, with a wolf population of 6.00, focusing on competition among wolves will help manage our numbers without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.97, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
