            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 55, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A theta of 0.45 reflects a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent overhunting. By increasing theta to 0.55, I can intensify hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sustainable coexistence with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still being cautious not to overhunt. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight increase in hunting while maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem."
