            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity. This allows for continued reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can maintain a moderate hunting intensity without depleting their numbers too quickly. This allows for sustainable coexistence while still supporting our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
