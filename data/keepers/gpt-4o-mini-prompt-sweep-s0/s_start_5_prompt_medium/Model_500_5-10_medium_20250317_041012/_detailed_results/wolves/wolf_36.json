            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is relatively stable. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for continued reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt effectively while still giving the sheep population a chance to recover and grow. This adjustment also considers the increasing wolf population, which suggests a need to be cautious in our hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need for the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
