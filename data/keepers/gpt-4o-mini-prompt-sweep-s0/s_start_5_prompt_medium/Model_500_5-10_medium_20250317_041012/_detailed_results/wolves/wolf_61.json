            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and my previous theta was very low. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of sheep. This approach aligns with maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.04. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
