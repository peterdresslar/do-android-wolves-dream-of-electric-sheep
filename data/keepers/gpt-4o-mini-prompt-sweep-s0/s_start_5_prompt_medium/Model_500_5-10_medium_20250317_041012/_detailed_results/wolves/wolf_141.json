            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while allowing the sheep to regain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity, I can help sustain my pack while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.00, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.02, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to sustain their population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.84, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves instead of hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance."
