            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This balance will help maintain the sheep population while supporting the growth of the wolf pack. A theta of 0.5 reflects a cautious approach, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to over-deplete them. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also addressing the growing wolf population by preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This moderate theta will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance."
