            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity while still ensuring the wolf population can thrive. This adjustment helps maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence as we gradually adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is crucial to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help maintain a balance that supports both our populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
