With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.50, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.30, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.65, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to hunt a bit more, but still prioritize the balance necessary for both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.49, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.97, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
