            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both wolves and sheep can coexist sustainably while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while allowing for their population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.00, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term survival for both species and prevents a crash in the sheep population."
