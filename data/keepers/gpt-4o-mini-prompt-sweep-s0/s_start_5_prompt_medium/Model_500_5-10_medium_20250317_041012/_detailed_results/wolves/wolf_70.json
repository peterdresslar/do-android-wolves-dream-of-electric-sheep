            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is essential to avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep population to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate approach will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This theta allows for gradual hunting while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species, as hunting intensity needs to be reduced to prevent further depletion of the sheep population."
