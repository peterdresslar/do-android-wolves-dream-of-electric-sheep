        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on reducing competition with other wolves, allowing for a gradual recovery of the sheep population while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and prioritizing long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.65, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.05, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still hunt effectively while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach balances the immediate needs of the wolf pack with the long-term health of both populations."
