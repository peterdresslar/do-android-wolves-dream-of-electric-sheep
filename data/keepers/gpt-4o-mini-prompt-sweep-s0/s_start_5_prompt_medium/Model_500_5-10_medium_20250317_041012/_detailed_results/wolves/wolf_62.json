            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 70% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.20 indicates that the sheep are under pressure. To ensure long-term survival and allow the sheep population to recover, I will adopt a more moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a gradual increase in hunting intensity will allow for a slight recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
