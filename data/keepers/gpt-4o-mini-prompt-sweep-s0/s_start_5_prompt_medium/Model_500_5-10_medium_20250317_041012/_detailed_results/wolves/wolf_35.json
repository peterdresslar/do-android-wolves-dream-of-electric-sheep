            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we should maintain a balanced approach to hunting. A moderate theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment is gradual, reflecting the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the growth of the wolf population, ensuring that we do not push either species to the brink.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
