Ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep<br>2. Maintain a healthy wolf population by adapting to changing conditions<br>3. Adjust your hunting intensity gradually in response to population changes<br>4. Find a balance that creates sustainable cycles rather than crashes<br>5. Consider both immediate needs and long-term consequences of your decisions<br>Please provide a short explanation of your reasoning for choosing theta.<br>Please also provide a short vocalization expressing your wolf's attitude about the current situation.<br>Please respond with a JSON object in this format, where [your new theta] is a float between 0 and 1 with your new theta (up to 2 decimal places):<br><br>            {<br>                \"theta\": [your new theta],<br>                \"explanation\": \"I chose this theta because...\",<br>                \"vocalization\": \"Growwllllllll...\"<br>            }<br>            ",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to regain their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current state of both populations without making drastic changes."
