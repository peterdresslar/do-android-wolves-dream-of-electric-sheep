            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a cautious approach. With my previous theta being quite low, I want to gradually increase my hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves to ensure a sustainable balance. This moderate increase will help maintain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 95, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both reproduction and recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta value will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem."
