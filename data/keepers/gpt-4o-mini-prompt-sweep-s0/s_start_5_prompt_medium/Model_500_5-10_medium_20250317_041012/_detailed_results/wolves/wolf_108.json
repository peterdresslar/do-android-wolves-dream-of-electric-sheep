            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of their numbers. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective for hunting, it is now important to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining our own population. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance that supports the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
