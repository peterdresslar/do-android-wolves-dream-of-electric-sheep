            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.00, which is only 2.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on a balanced approach that allows the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.4 will help us avoid overhunting and create a sustainable cycle.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.30, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and preventing over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.65, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.05, which is only 2.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for a gradual response to the current state of both populations."
