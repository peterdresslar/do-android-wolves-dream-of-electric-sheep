            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, ensuring both populations can coexist sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating a need for careful management. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance while allowing for some sheep recovery. This moderate adjustment supports both the wolf population and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, as I aim to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it is wise to maintain a cautious approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
