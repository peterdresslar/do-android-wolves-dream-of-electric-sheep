            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain both populations. This value reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves as our numbers are relatively low. It is essential to avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively stable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population control while giving them a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between the two populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly. However, given the current wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence, I will make a modest adjustment to ensure we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and to ensure long-term survival, I need to balance hunting with the competition among wolves. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well."
