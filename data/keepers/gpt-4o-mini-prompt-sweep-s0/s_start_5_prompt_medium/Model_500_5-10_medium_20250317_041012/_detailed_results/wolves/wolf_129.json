            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing balance and coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves. This adjustment will help maintain the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 represents a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while preventing further depletion of their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability."
