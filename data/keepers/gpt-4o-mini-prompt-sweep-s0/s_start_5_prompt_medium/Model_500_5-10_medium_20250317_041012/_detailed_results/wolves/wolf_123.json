        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.03, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
