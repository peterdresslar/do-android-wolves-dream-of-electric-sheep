            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a balance, I can afford to keep a moderate hunting intensity to ensure my pack can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.06. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. With the wolf population being relatively high, focusing on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further."
