            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that hunting intensity can be slightly reduced to allow for recovery while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious response to the growing wolf population, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure sustainable coexistence and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. It also considers the current wolf population, which is relatively high, suggesting a need to be cautious with hunting intensity to avoid future competition issues.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting, but not enough to deplete the sheep further. This approach promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that we should prioritize their recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still focusing on reducing competition among wolves. This approach helps maintain a balance and supports the long-term survival of both species."
