            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 68.8% of maximum capacity and a low wolf population, a moderate theta of 0.5 will help maintain the delicate balance between hunting and competition with other wolves. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while ensuring the sheep can recover and the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 74.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 81.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with only 5 wolves, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 40.49, suggesting that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly to ensure our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 217.35, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta will help maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. It allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change without risking the depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 13, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is close to its maximum capacity, indicating that we should be cautious with our hunting to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.06, a moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a cautious approach that considers both immediate needs and long-term consequences.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and to avoid over-depleting the sheep, I will adopt a moderate hunting intensity. This allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my theta slightly to 0.55, I can intensify my hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further."
