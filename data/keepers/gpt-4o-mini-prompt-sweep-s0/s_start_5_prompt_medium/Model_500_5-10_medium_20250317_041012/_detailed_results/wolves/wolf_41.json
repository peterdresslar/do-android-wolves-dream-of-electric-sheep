            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. This balance will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still promoting sustainability. This adjustment reflects a balance between maintaining my pack's health and ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while also focusing on reducing competition among wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 174. This approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability."
