            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep recovery while also ensuring that the wolf population remains stable. This balance is crucial for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.30, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.65, which is only 2.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance."
