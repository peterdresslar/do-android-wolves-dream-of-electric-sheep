            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A balanced approach is crucial to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain harmony in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 70% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while preventing overhunting. As the sheep population is currently above the sustainable level, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted, but I want to avoid drastic changes to ensure long-term stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a wolf population of 144, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our own population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep's recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to deplete them further. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
