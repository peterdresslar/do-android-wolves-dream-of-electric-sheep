            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support reproduction without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A small increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can begin to take advantage of the low sheep population while still allowing for some recovery. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some level of competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for their recovery. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes, ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.84, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity now, it could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.80, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to repopulate while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.77, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
