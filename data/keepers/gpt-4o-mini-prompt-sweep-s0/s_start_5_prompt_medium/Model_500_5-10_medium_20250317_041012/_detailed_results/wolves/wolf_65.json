            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 70% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 95, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By reducing my hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to slightly increase my hunting intensity to help stabilize the sheep population while still being cautious not to over-deplete them. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population increase while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
