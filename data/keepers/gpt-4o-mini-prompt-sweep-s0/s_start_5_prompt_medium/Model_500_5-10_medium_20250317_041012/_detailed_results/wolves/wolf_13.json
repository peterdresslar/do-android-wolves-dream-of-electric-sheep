            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 8.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring sustainable coexistence with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep while still enabling the wolves to thrive. This approach supports a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can afford to increase our hunting intensity slightly without risking immediate depletion. However, given the current wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase to 0.55 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a moderate hunting intensity is necessary. This theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash."
