            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking a severe depletion of the sheep. This value strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for sustainable coexistence as wolf numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while also allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will allow for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
