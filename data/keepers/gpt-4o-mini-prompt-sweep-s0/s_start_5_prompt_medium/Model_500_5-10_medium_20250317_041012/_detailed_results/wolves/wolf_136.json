            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was already focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This small adjustment reflects the need for balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while also addressing the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring that our wolf pack does not overhunt and face a crash. A gradual adjustment to 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
