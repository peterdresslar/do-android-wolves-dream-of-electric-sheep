            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, and the sheep population is at a sustainable level. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help maintain our numbers while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and avoid depleting the sheep further, while also keeping an eye on the wolf population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, maintaining a balance that can adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting would further deplete their numbers and threaten the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.00, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still considering the competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still prioritizing competition with other wolves. This adjustment helps maintain a balance, allowing the sheep population to recover without putting too much pressure on it.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.84, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.80, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting, ensuring that I adapt to the current low sheep population without depleting it further."
