            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also allowing for some wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and adapting to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in the sheep population, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population."
