            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to increase hunting intensity to ensure my pack can reproduce. A theta of 0.70 allows for a moderate increase in hunting while still being mindful of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance, preventing overhunting and allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and allow for future sustainable cycles. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need to maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.00, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases the chances of sustainable coexistence. Given the high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under significant pressure, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 49, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.84, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for a gradual recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.80, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.77, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
