            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current ecosystem state while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to ensure our wolf population remains healthy. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to gradually adapt to the conditions while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species."
