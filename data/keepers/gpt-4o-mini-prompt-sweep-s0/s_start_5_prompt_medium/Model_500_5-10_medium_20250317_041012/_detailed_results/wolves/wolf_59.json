            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports our wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a small boost in hunting to help sustain my pack while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic equilibrium.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity.
