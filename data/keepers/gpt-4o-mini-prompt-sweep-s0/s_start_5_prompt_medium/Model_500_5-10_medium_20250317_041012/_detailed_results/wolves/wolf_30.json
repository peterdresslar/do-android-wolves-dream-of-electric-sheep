        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that they can sustain a bit more hunting without risking depletion. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid sudden changes, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing for gradual adaptation to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 55, it's important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for sustainable hunting while also considering the need for coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being significant, a moderate increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our survival without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing pressure on the sheep while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations."
