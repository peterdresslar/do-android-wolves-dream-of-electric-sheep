        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for a small increase in hunting intensity. This approach helps to ensure the sheep can recover while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while preventing overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 0.02, it is essential to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance."
