            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 144, it is important to avoid overhunting to prevent depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both reproduction in wolves and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective for hunting, it is important to gradually reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure their recovery and maintain a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This moderate approach allows for a gradual increase in sheep numbers while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is quite high. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta was too low for effective hunting. A slight increase to 0.25 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary, but I must prioritize sustainability over immediate gains.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance."
