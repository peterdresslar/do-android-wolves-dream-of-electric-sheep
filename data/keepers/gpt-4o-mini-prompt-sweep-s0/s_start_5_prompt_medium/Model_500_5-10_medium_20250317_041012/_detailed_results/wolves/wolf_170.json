            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.03, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining some level of competition with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sustainability.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, which would jeopardize the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.91, which is only 0.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 allows for a small adjustment in hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.84, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.80, which suggests a need for caution in hunting to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me balance the need for hunting with the importance of not depleting the sheep further. This moderate adjustment aligns with the goal of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.79, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.81, which is only 0.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 0.85, which suggests a need for cautious hunting to allow for recovery. However, with the wolf population at 13, I must also consider the competition among wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability."
