            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain a healthy balance. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while there are many sheep available, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This moderate approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both immediate needs and long-term consequences.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is essential to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. By increasing theta to 0.55, I can intensify hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions and avoiding sudden shifts."
