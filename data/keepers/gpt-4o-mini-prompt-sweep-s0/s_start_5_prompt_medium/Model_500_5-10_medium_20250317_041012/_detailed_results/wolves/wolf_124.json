            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves to maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their collapse. By focusing more on competing with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, which necessitates a focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while also competing with other wolves to stabilize our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a significant decline in sheep, jeopardizing future food sources for the wolf population. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
