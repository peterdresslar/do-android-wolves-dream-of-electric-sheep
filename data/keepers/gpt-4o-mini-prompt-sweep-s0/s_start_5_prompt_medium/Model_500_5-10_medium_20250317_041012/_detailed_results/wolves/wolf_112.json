            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to compete with other wolves while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that intense hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population some time to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
