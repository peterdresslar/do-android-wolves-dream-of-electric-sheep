            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can increase our hunting intensity without risking a rapid decline in their numbers. A moderate increase to 0.7 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 70% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population remains stable while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.3 was already focused on competition with other wolves. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity, I will make a small adjustment to 0.35. This will help ensure a sustainable balance between both populations."
