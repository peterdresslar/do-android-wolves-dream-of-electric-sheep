        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while promoting balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance, a slight increase in hunting intensity will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This adjustment allows for a sustainable approach while still being mindful of the current ecosystem dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.03, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebuild their numbers while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
