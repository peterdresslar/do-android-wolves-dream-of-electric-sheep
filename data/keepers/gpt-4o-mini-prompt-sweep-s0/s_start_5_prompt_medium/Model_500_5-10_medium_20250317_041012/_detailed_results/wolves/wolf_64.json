            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.70 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can grow, while also being mindful of the increasing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe imbalance. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
