            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is important to maintain a balance that allows for both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, the current state suggests a need for a more balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly to 0.55, I can help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.67, which is only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs but prioritizes the long-term balance and recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while allowing the sheep to regain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.03, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also addressing the competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
