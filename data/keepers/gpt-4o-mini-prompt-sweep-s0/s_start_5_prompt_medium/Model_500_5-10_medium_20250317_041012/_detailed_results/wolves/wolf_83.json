            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our needs but prioritizes the sustainability of both species in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still considering the needs of the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence."
