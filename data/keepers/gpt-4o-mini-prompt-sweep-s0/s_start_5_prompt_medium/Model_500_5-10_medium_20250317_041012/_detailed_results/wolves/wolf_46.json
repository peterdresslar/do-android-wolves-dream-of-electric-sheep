            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from the previous value, I can focus more on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help balance the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further."
