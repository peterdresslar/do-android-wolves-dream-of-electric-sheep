            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 17.67, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also need to ensure that the sheep do not become too depleted. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, indicating that we can maintain a sustainable hunting intensity without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both wolf and sheep populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 95, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
