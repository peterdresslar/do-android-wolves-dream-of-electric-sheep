            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves and promote a sustainable balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current low sheep numbers while being cautious not to overhunt.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant imbalance. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
