            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 81.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a low wolf population of only 5, it is wise to focus more on competing with other wolves to ensure our numbers can stabilize before increasing hunting intensity. A gradual increase in theta allows for a sustainable balance while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with only 8 wolves, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 91.9% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is nearing its maximum capacity, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have the opportunity to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a more sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 89.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 95, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate. This will help balance the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
