            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 70% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.84, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A moderate theta of 0.3 will help ensure that I focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover and grow sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 144, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help achieve this balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to adapt to the current low sheep numbers while still considering the gradual recovery of the sheep population. This will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
