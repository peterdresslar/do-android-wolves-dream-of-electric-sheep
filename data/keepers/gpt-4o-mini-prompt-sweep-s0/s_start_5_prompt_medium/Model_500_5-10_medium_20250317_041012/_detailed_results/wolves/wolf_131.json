        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.2% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.70, a slight adjustment towards a balanced approach will help maintain both populations sustainably while allowing for gradual adaptation to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.80, which is only 13.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still focusing on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.3% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.44, which is only 2.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low at 0.02. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the extinction of sheep, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.00, which is just 0.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. As the wolf population is relatively high, focusing on competition rather than aggressive hunting will help stabilize both populations in the long term."
