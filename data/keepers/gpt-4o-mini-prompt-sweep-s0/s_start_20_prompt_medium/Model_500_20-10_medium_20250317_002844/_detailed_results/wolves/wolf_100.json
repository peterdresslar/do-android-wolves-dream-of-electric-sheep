            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.65, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive while avoiding depletion of resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to allow for a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.450 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance and allows for recovery in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.22, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.92, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 43, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow for a recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.93, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.35, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time."
