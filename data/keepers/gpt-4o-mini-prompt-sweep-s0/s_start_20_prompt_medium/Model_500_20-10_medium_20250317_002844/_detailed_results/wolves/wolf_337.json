            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps prevent overhunting and maintains the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help achieve this balance, as the wolf population is relatively high at 66.00.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring our wolf population remains stable. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.03, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help maintain the balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 17.07, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
