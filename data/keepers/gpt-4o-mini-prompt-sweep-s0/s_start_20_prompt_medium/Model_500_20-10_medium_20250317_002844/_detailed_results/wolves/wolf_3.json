            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.01, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.09, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. While the sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that there are enough sheep for hunting, I want to ensure that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt enough to support our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.3% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A lower theta allows for competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.90, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both."
