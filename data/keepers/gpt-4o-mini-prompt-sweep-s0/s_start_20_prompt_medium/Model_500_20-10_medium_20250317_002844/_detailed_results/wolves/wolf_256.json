            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to adapt to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes and responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I can hunt enough to support the wolf population while also allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 29, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering the hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance."
