            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for a sustainable balance, enabling the sheep population to recover while still supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while I need to maintain a balance for the wolf population, I should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to sustain my pack while not over-depleting the sheep, promoting a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing the competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 5.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to hunting as the sheep population is not yet at a sustainable level.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.96, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
