            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations without risking depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also growing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still focusing on the needs of my wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as their numbers are relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.70, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still considering the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.79, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 40, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low at 0.47, indicating competition among wolves is high. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on ensuring the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further."
