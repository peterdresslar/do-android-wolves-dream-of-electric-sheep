            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 41.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.04, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a decline in the sheep population and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This value balances the need for wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive, maintaining the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive while also considering the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate approach will help balance the ecosystem while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By lowering theta to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 59, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.48, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can rebound, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.23, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.24, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By increasing my theta slightly to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.66, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting."
