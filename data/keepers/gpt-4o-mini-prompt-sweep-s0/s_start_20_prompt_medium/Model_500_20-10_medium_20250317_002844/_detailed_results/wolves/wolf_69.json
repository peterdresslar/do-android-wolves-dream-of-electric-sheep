            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.67, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to gradually increase in number while maintaining a stable wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
