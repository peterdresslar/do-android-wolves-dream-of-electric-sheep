            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between sustaining our wolf population and ensuring the sheep can recover, while also considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to gradually increase hunting intensity, I must also consider the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for a balanced approach, ensuring both sheep and wolves can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to take advantage of the available prey while still being cautious about the wolf population, which is at 66.00. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence and gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.90, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also helping to stabilize the wolf population. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can ensure that both populations have a chance to thrive without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.66, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without overexploiting our prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.39, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable some hunting to support our reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
