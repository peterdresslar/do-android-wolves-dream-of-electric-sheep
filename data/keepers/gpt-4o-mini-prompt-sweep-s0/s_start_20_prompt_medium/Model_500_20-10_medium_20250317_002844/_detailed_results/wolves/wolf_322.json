            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to maintain a balance to ensure the sheep can recover and the wolf population remains stable. A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for sustainable hunting while keeping an eye on the dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I can hunt enough to support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough food for the wolves. This approach supports long-term coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure the wolf population can thrive. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help maintain the sheep population while also keeping the wolf population in check."
