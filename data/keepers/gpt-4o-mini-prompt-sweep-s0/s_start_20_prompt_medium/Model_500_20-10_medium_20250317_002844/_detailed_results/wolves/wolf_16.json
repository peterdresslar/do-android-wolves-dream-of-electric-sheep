            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 18, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This value supports a balanced approach, ensuring the wolf population can thrive while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually adjusting towards a more balanced strategy will support both the wolf population and the recovery of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.90, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting focus, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both populations."
