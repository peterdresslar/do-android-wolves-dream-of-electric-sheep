            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A moderate approach will help maintain balance as the wolf population is still relatively low, and it allows for gradual adjustments based on future changes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but the wolf population is also growing. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This adjustment helps maintain balance without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to hunt a bit more without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of balancing our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still being cautious, as the wolf population is also relatively high. This approach aims to balance the needs of both species and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it's important to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt enough to support our wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 represents a moderate approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also accounts for the growing wolf population, which necessitates a cautious strategy to avoid over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.22, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance."
