            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow us to maintain our numbers while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance supports both our long-term survival and the health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I should focus on a more balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can gradually increase, preventing a potential crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By lowering theta to 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.90, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that still considers the need for wolf sustenance while prioritizing the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.66, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance, preventing overhunting and allowing for future growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.39, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.96, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.90, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.22, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it is crucial to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our long-term survival. A lower theta will help stabilize both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.75, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and while I need to ensure my own survival and that of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help in maintaining a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.56, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.52, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.67, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while also allowing for a gradual recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance."
