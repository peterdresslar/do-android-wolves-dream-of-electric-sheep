            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 28.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough sheep to support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population. This approach aligns with maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.03, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.07, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence."
