            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still recovering and I want to maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 44.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but it is still below half of its maximum capacity. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to thrive. This balance will help avoid over-depletion of sheep and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (22.6% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population, which is at 64. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance as both populations change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 58, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.29, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.28, which is only 7.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.44, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.03, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash."
