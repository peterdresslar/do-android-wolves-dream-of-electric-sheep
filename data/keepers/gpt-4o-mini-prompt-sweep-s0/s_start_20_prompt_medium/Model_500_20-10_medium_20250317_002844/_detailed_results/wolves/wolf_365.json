            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover.
