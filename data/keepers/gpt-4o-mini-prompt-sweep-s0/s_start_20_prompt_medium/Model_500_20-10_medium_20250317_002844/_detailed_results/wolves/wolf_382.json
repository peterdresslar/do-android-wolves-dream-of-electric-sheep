            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep population at 45.6% of maximum capacity, I can afford to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both wolf and sheep populations remain sustainable. This adjustment allows for gradual increases in hunting as the sheep population grows while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 20, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes to ensure a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta of 0.450 was focused on moderate hunting, I believe a slight reduction to 0.40 will allow for a more balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce my hunting intensity. By lowering theta to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to gradually increase in number, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover and avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a potential for overhunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, while also competing with other wolves in a sustainable manner.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack"
