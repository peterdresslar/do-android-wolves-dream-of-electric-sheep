            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 12, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can afford to reduce my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the sheep can recover while still allowing for sustainable wolf reproduction. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid sudden changes, a gradual increase is the most prudent approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 29, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also enabling the wolf population to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep recover, while also ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep."
