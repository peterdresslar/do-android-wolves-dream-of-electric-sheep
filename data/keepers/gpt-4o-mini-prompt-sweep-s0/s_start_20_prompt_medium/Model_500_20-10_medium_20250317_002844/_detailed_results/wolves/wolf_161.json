            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. While the sheep population is recovering, I want to ensure that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly. A theta of 0.60 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of both sheep and wolf populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This balance will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations over the long term, while also considering the current growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance, as the wolf population is also growing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.61, which is only 22.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more while still focusing on the long-term balance of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a gradual balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.29, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep population while allowing for a gradual recovery. This approach balances my need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.28, which is only 7.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.44, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
