            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.00, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.724 reflects a more aggressive hunting strategy, it is essential to shift towards a more balanced approach to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.5 will enable sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.01, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery while still maintaining a balance with the wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.50 reflects a more moderate approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.09, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.35, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
