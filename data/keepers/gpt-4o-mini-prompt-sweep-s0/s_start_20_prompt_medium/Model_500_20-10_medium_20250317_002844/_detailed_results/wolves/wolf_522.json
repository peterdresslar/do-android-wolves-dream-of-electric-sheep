While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to rebound, maintaining a sustainable balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach. This adjustment acknowledges the need to hunt while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. It reflects a cautious strategy that avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
