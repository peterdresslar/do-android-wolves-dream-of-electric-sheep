This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support our wolf population without risking the depletion of sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.03, which is only 13.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.66, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 39.44, which is only 15.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growth of our own wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem balance."
