            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A gradual approach is essential to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This approach aligns with the need for balance, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to hunt without jeopardizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the need for balance. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable environment. A moderate theta of 0.35 helps to balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack, but it prioritizes the long-term health of both populations by avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.48, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.23, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves."
