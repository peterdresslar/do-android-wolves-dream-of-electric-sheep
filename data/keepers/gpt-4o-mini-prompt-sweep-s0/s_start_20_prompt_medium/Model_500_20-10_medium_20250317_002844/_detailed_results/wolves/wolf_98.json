            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overhunted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that while there are enough sheep to support hunting, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.45, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual growth in both populations while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.4 will help balance our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help stabilize both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.22, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.92, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.93, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species."
