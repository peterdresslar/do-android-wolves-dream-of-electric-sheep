            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a relatively high wolf population and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 8.04, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 23, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I want to ensure that we do not deplete their numbers too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. This slight reduction from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A slight decrease from my previous theta will also help mitigate competition among wolves as our numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, as the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates there are enough sheep to sustain both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment helps ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase from my previous theta balances the need for reproduction with the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for continued competition among wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting, but I must avoid overexploitation as the wolf population is already significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance."
