            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep's recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 9.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain a high hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This will help maintain the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity while still competing with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 5.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.96, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep"
