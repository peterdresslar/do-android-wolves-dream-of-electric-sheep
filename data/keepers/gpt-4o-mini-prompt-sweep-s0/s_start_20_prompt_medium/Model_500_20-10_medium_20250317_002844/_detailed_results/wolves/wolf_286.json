            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. Given that the sheep-to-wolf ratio is above 2, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance, as the sheep population is recovering, and I want to avoid overhunting while still ensuring the wolf population can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (21.8% of maximum capacity), allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring the wolves can sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.42, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for a gradual increase in hunting as the sheep population stabilizes. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I maintain a cautious approach. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 31.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves and help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to increase their population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.16, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of both populations."
