            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive, preventing future depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population growth. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a healthier ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.42, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves at this lower theta, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes and grows, allowing for a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.16, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need to sustain both populations while still being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep while allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.47, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.86, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 7.0% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction. However, I want to avoid overhunting and allow the sheep population to recover, so a moderate increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves."
