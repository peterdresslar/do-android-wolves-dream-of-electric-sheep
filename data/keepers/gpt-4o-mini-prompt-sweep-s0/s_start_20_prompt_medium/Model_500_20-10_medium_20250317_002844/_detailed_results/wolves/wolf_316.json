            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 9, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.58 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 9.65, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain both populations sustainably while avoiding over-depletion of sheep. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and ensures the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting healthy wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 28, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain both populations while adapting to their trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population dynamics.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while keeping an eye on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring our wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover. It is a small, gradual change that aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting."
