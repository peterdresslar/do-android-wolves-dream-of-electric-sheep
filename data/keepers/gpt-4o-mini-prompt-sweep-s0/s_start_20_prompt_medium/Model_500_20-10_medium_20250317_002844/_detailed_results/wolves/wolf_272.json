            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 29, which is relatively high compared to the sheep, I need to ensure that I do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment to 0.48 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both species. This moderate adjustment reflects the need to balance our hunting with the competition among wolves, ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep while still supporting our own population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while we can increase our hunting intensity slightly, we must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance needed for sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A lower theta will allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 48.00, it is crucial to focus on reducing competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep"
