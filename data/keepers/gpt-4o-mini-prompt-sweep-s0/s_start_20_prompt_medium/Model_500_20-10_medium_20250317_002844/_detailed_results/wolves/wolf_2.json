            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate theta of 0.4 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.01, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.09, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. This suggests that a slight reduction in hunting intensity is prudent to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.90, which is only 10% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting."
