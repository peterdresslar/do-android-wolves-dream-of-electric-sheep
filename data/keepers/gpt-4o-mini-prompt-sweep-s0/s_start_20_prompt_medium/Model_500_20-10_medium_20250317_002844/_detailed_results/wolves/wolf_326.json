            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.16, a moderate approach will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition among wolves, allowing both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. Gradually increasing theta allows us to adapt to the current conditions without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 2.20, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while keeping an eye on the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This value reflects a cautious approach, enabling me to adapt to the current conditions without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the current sheep population and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that encourages coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also accounts for the growing wolf population, which necessitates a cautious approach to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced strategy that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.03, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both populations."
