            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 38.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 44, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to help sustain wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with the wolf population at 60, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.03, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual approach allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.07, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should prioritize allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash."
