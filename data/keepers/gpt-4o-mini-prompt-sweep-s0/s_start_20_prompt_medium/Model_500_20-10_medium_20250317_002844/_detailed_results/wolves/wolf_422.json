            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This value balances the need to maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a slight reduction from my previous theta will help avoid overhunting and promote long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.32, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity. This approach will help support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.74, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.02, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain the wolf population while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.88, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.24, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity should be increased to support wolf reproduction, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the need for wolves to thrive and the necessity of allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.96, which is only 6.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.79, which is only 5.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.93, which is only 6.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.06, which is only 6.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and promotes long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.43, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still maintaining a focus on the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.88, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.42, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly."
