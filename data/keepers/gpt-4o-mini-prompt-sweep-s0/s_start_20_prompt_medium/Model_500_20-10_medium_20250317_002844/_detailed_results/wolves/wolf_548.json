            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding overexploitation and fostering a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 59.81, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 was effective for hunting, it is important to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. By setting theta at 0.45, I can balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to increase in number, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize our numbers without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This approach aligns with my objective of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can focus on sustainable hunting while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 47.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. This lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 5.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.96, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.52, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking the depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.3% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.23, which is only 5.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.30, which is only 5.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still support the wolf population"
