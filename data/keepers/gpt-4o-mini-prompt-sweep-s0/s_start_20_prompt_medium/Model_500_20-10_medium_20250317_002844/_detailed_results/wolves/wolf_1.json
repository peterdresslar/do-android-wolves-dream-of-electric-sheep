            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while avoiding intense hunting. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, supporting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.01, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on maintaining a balance while allowing for some growth in the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low percentage of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
