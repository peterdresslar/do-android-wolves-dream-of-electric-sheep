            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 10.56, it is wise to focus on maintaining balance and allowing for some recovery in the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate theta of 0.3 allows for sustainable coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 13, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 8.48, suggesting that we should be cautious about overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 16, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 7.12, suggesting that we should not overhunt to maintain balance. A slight increase in theta allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure both species can coexist in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 25, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic changes in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I need to balance hunting with competition among wolves. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, a more cautious approach is warranted to avoid overhunting and ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious about depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.32, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize without depleting their numbers further. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
