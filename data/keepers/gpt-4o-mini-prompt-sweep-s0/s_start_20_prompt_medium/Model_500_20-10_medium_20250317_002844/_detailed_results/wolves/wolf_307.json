            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to rebound while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors and promotes a sustainable balance.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to population trends.",
