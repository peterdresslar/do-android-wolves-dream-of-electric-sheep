            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to maintain our wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, a moderate theta will help maintain both populations while avoiding overhunting. This adjustment supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain our wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps avoid over-depletion of the sheep and maintains a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 63, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we reduce hunting intensity. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, at only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.79, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
