            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depletion of sheep, a moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. A moderate approach aligns with the current dynamics and promotes coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 34, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase in theta reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 54.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in our ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
