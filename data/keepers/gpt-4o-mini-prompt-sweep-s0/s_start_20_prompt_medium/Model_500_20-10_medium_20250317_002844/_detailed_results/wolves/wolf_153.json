            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in hunting will support our reproductive needs without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt effectively while still ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive. This adjustment also considers the growth of the wolf population, which requires a careful balance to avoid over-depletion of our prey.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover and the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.61, which is only 22.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable environment for both species. Gradually reducing hunting intensity will help maintain the balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.29, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further."
