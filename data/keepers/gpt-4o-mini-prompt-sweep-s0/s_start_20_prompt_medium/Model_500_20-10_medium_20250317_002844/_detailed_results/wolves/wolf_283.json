            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 94.77, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to support a moderate hunting intensity. This theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. It also reflects a gradual adjustment to the current conditions, avoiding drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity is wise as the wolf population is relatively high, and we need to avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to ensure that the sheep have a chance to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a gradual increase in their numbers. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid overhunting, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying my hunting. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
