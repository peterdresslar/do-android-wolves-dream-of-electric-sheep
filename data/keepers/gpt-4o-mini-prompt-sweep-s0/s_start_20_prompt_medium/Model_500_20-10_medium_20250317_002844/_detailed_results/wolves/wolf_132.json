            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 23.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 25.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively low wolf population of 5.00, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health.",

This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to adapt to the current ecosystem dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population of 12, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual growth in both populations while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate hunting intensity will allow me to maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for some recovery of the sheep population while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I should maintain a focus on hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can recover sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to regain their numbers. Additionally, with the wolf population at 62, it"
