            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 34, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that balances our needs with the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being nearly equal to the sheep population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking immediate depletion. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population, which is currently at 63.00.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance between wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.70, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize while preventing overhunting. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.
