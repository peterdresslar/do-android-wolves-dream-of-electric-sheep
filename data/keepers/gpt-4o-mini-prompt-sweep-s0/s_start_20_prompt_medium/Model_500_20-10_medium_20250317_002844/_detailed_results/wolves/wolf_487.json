            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A balanced approach is essential to maintain the delicate ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to increase in number. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta value, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to maintain a balance to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.48, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.66, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balanced approach that supports both the wolf population and the recovery of the sheep, while still being mindful of the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.13, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can still focus on maintaining a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure sustainable coexistence.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.61, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.55, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.16, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a slight decrease in hunting intensity is warranted. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and promote a more sustainable ecosystem."
