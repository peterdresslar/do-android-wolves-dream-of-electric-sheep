            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity, a moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. By setting theta at 0.45, I can maintain a balance that promotes coexistence and prevents overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. However, since the wolf population is relatively high at 66, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that can support both the wolf population and the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers while still allowing for some competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 59.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.42. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only moderately to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring sustainability without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 31.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.16, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This approach will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes and grows, allowing for a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to balance the needs of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.47, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.86, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to increase my hunting intensity to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.99, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.80, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, ensuring we do not over-deplete the sheep while still competing effectively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.63, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.75, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can ensure a sustainable balance that allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
