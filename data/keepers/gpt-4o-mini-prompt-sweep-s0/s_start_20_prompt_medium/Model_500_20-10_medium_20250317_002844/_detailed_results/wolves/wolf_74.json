            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both wolves and sheep can thrive while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.69, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure that both populations can thrive. This adjustment allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 24, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach to ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must also consider the potential for overhunting. A moderate approach allows for a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This strategy supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, aligning with the wisdom of gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain hunting while also considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach while still being cautious as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance."
