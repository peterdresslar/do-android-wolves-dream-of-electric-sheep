            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 59.81, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.58 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.550 allowed for some hunting, it is important to reduce hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between my needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our own population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to stabilize and grow, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species. Gradual adjustments are key, and this moderate value reflects a balance between competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to stabilize. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 5.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.96, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",

This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.23, which is only 5.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance that prevents overhunting and promotes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a high hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting approach while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.77, which is only 5.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.27, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.83, which is only 5.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.
