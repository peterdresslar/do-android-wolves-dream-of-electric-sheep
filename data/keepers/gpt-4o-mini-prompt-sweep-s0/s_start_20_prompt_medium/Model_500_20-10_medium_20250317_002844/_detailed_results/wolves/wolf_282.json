            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 37, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition among wolves, which will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for increased hunting intensity without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance, preventing over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes and grows, allowing for a more sustainable ecosystem in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.41, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still focusing on the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to rebound. A lower theta will support a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 31.00, maintaining a lower theta will help prevent overcompetition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting. A gradual approach is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species."
