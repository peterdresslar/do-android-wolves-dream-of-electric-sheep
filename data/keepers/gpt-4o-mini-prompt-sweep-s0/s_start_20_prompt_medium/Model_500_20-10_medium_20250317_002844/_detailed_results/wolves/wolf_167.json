            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and ensures long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.19, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help focus on competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current state of the ecosystem and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which will help stabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.45, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while gradually adjusting to the dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.29, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.28, which is only 7.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.44, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can help the wolf population thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.03, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in sheep numbers, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.82, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while being mindful of their population"
