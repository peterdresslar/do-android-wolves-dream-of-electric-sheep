            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 23, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 30, I need to be cautious about overhunting, as it could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm the wolf population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 2.73, I can maintain sustainable hunting while ensuring the sheep population can recover. This moderate theta allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, which is crucial for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking their depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual approach helps maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.48, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem."
