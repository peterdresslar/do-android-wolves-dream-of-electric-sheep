While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep population to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf pack to thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity.
