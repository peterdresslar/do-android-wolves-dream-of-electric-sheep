            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 51, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.19, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as it could lead to a decline in the sheep population and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. A moderate theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.61, which is only 22.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious and avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance and sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the sustainability of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.29, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.28, which is only 7.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without causing sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.44, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.03, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.82, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash."
