            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.58, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can maintain a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population has the opportunity to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta will also account for the growing wolf population, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also considering the need to compete with other wolves as our population increases. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overhunting."
