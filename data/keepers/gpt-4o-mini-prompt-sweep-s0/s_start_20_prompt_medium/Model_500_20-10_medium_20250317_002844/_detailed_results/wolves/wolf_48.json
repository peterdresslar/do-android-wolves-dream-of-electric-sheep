            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A gradual approach is essential to ensure both populations can thrive without crashing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting but prioritizes competition among wolves, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further and can maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.90, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, ensuring both our survival and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.66, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help maintain the balance and promote the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.39, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.96, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.90, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.22, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.75, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers the current low sheep population and the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.56, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help the sheep population increase while also stabilizing the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.52, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population.
