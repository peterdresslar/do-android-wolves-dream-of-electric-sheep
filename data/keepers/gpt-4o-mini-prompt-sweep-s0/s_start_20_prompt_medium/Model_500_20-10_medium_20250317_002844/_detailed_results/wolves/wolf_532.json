            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate approach will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 59.81, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity, a moderate approach is more sustainable. By setting theta at 0.45, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows the sheep population to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 74, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.72, which is only 5.9% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.35, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep."
