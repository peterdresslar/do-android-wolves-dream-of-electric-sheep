            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.25, I can focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while still maintaining some level of wolf presence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.01, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence. By maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers."
