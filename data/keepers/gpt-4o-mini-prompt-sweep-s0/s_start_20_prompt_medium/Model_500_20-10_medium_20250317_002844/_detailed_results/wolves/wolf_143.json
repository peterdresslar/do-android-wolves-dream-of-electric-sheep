            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that allows the sheep population to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance, ensuring that the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 36, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach promotes a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves as their population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.8% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling the wolf population to compete effectively with each other. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival while ensuring the sheep population can stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species."
