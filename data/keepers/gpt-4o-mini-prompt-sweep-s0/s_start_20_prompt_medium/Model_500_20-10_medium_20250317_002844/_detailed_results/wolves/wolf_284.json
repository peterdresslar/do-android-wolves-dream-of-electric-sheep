            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 54, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate adjustment to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.12, it indicates that while there are enough sheep for hunting, we need to be cautious not to over-deplete their numbers. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on maintaining both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population is also relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus more on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers and ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.52, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also reducing competition among wolves as the population is relatively high."
