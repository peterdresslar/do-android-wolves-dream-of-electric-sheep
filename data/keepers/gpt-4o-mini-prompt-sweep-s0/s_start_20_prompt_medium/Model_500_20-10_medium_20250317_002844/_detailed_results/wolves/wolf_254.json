            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 15, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.34, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not deplete too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, considering the need to avoid overhunting and to adapt to the current ecosystem dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids the risks associated with overhunting or excessive competition among wolves.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough to support the wolf population while also allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 54, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species."
