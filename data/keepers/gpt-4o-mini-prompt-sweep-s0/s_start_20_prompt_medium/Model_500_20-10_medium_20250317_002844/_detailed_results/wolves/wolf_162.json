However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.82, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 44.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the wolf population grows, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support the wolf population while still considering the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 22.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.91, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.45 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still keeping an eye on the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.29, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity slightly to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A gradual increase allows for a more sustainable balance as the sheep population recovers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.44, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, fostering a sustainable ecosystem.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.
