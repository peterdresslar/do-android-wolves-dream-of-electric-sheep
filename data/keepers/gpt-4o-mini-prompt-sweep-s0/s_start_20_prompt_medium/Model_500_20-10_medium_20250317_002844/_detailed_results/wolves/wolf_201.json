            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help ensure the wolf population can thrive while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding any drastic impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate increase in hunting will help sustain our pack while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 2.98, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This moderate hunting intensity will help prevent over-depletion of the sheep while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This balance will help maintain both wolf and sheep populations in the long term, as it allows for some hunting while also considering the growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, but I must also be mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A gradual increase will help maintain balance while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 24.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling us to compete effectively with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes that could lead to crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, while also considering the growing wolf population."
