            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 10.44, it is important to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually increasing theta will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf-to-sheep ratio of 5.69, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain a balance as the wolf population grows, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious about the wolf population growth. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a sustainable balance while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This approach helps ensure that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, given the wolf population is also significant, I want to avoid overhunting and ensure a balance that supports both species in the long term. A gradual increase from my previous theta allows for adaptation without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta was 0.450, I want to slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers. This will help maintain a sustainable balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A theta of 0.40 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
