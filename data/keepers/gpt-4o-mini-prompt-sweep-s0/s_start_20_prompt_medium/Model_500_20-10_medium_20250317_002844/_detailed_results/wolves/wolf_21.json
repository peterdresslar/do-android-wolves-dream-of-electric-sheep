            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain our population without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to replenish while still enabling wolves to compete effectively.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.90, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This moderate approach helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.66, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions."
