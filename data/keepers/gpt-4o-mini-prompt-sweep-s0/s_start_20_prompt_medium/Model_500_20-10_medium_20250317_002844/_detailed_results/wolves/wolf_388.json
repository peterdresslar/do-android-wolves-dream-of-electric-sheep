            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 25, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while also considering the need for wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is wise to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I want to ensure that the sheep can recover and thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and allow both populations to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help balance the competition among wolves and give sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should maintain a cautious approach to hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with the wolf population at 68.00, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to ensure our own survival and reproduction. A theta of 0.40 represents a moderate adjustment that balances our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.74, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the wolf population sustainably."
