            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight increase in theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. This adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach, considering the need for balance as both populations are interconnected.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep and to adapt to the current dynamics of the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for the sheep to recover if we maintain a moderate hunting intensity. By slightly increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can balance the need for hunting to support our wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the needs of both species."
