            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate increase in theta will help sustain both populations while ensuring we can continue to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.56, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as it could lead to a depletion of sheep and ultimately harm the wolf population. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the wolf population is also significant. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance while ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 62.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 59.81, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 70, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low, indicating that a more competitive environment among wolves could be beneficial. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on competition while still enabling some hunting to maintain wolf health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since my previous theta was 0.300 and the wolf population is relatively high, a slight increase to 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize."
