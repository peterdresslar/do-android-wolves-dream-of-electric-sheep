            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can reproduce, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 48.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a higher hunting intensity without risking depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.16, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if we allow the sheep to increase. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while also addressing the growing wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
