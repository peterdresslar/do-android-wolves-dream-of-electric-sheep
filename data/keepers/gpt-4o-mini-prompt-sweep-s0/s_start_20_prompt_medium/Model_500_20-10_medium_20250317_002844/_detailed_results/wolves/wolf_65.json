            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.90, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.66, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.39, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity.

A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.96, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 16.90, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance the needs of both wolves and sheep, while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.22, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 35.00, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover.
