            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This value balances the need to sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become depleted. It reflects a cautious approach, responding to the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 57.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 64.57, which is only 25.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance, giving sheep a chance to recover while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 68, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. By increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population while still allowing for recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.32, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep to recover and avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.74, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.37, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by reducing pressure on the sheep while we compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.02, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolf pack and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further."
