            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.4 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still considering the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.98, it indicates that we should be cautious about hunting too aggressively. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover, ensuring a balance that supports both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overhunted. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate hunting intensity is appropriate. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still focusing on competition with other wolves. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.22, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 47, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.92, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
