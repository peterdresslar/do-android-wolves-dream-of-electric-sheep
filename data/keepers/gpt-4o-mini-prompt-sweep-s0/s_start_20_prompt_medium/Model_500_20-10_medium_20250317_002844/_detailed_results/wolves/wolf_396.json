            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.46, a moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This gradual increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta allows us to adapt to the current conditions without risking a sudden depletion of the sheep.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.32, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus more on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species while still permitting some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach while still being cautious about the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.74, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain a balance and prevent depleting the sheep further."
