However, with the wolf population at 33, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 42, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase is prudent to ensure both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 62.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both populations to thrive while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 59.81, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for moderate hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack but prioritizes the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.31, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem while still allowing for gradual adjustments in the future."
