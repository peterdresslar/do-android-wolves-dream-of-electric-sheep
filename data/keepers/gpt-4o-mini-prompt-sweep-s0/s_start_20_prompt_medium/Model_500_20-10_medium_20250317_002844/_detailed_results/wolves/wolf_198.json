            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain a dynamic equilibrium in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. By maintaining a balance, I can avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.94, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure the long-term survival of both populations. This adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can maintain my hunting intensity without risking depletion of the sheep population. This moderate theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.34, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while also enabling the sheep population to recover. This approach balances the needs of both wolves and sheep, ensuring long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing both populations to stabilize and ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a moderate level of competition among wolves. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, promoting the long-term survival of both species without overexploiting the sheep."
