            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 65, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is also quite low at 0.88, suggesting that if I increase hunting intensity too much, it could lead to a depletion of the sheep population and ultimately harm both species. A moderate theta of 0.3 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance and survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly to 0.40, I can take advantage of the current sheep numbers while still allowing for sustainable coexistence. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.9% of maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow their numbers to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both sheep and wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions without risking a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep to grow, avoiding any drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.07, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are under pressure, and while I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also being cautious not to over-deplete their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population has a chance to rebound while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase is prudent to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively low. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling my pack to thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and adapting to the current conditions.",

This value balances the need to maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It reflects a cautious approach, considering both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 7, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach while still enabling some hunting.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
