            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.56, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overhunting, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population remains sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It is important to make gradual changes to ensure stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overexploitation, as the wolf population is also significant. A gradual increase will help maintain balance and ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.61, which is only 22.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus more on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying our hunting. A moderate theta will help maintain a balance, allowing for the wolf population to stabilize while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep population too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the survival of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to sustain our own numbers. A moderate theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover without depleting their numbers further."
