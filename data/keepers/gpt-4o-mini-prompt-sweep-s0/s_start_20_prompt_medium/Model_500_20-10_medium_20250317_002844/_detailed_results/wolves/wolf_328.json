            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.16, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 28, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.05, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.03, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes."
