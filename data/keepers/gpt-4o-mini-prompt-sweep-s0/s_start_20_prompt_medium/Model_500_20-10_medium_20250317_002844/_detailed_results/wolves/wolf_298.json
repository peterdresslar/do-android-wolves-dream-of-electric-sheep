This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also supporting the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need for sustainable coexistence. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can ensure that the sheep population has a chance to stabilize while still allowing for some hunting to maintain the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while allowing our wolf pack to adapt to the changing conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",

With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.52, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting.
