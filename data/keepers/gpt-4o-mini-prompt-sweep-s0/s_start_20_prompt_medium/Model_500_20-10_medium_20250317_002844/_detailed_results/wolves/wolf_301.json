This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",

While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about overhunting.

This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover.
