            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.93, it is wise to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to adapt gradually, a slight increase from my previous theta will support both my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and I want to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This small adjustment allows for a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to increase. A lower theta will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.66, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.39, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.96, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.90, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.22, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
