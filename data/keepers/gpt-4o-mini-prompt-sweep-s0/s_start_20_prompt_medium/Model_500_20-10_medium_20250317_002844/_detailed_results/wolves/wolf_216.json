            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both species. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure that the sheep can recover and that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a moderate increase will promote coexistence and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.45, I can balance the need for hunting with the importance of sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that our wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.70, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.79, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.2% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further."
