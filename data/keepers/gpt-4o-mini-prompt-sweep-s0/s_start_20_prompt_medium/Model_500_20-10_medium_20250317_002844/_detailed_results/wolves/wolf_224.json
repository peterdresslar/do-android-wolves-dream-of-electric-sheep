            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid depleting the sheep further, a lower theta will allow for recovery while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.25, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion of the sheep. A moderate increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, supporting both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing for sustainable coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 63.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on both hunting and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainable coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.70, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.79, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.97, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population rebound while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.39, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.350, I can maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.10, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover.
