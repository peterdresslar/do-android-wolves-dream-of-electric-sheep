            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, it is essential to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves and support the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 68.57, which is only 27.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the potential for future growth in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also reflects the need to reduce hunting intensity slightly due to the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also addressing the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with my goal of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.57, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to adapt to the current conditions while still being mindful of the wolf population growth. This gradual adjustment helps maintain sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.78, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population has a chance to stabilize while also allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.16, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity to support the wolf population. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that encourages coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.19, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling my pack to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.86, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.
