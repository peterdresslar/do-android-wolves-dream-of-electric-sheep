            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is potential for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 13.15, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 15, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight increase in hunting will help ensure our long-term survival without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can afford to focus on sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting. This will help maintain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and ensures that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 37, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still enabling sheep recovery and maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain hunting pressure while also considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment will help sustain both populations over the long term without risking a dramatic decline in either.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for more effective hunting while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 66, maintaining a focus on competition among wolves will help stabilize our numbers while ensuring the sheep can flourish. A gradual adjustment is key to achieving a sustainable balance.",
