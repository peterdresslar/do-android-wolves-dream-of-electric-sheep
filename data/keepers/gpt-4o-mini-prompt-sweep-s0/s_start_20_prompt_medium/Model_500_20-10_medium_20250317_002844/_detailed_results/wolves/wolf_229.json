            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 83.25, which is only 33.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance our hunting needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem, preventing over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.76, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a modest hunting intensity that can help sustain my pack while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.4 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf survival with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize without depleting their numbers further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.70, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to replenish while preventing overhunting. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support the wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the potential for future growth in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.79, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.47, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent over-exploitation of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain higher hunting intensity without risking their population further. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.10, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.04, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.23, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem."
