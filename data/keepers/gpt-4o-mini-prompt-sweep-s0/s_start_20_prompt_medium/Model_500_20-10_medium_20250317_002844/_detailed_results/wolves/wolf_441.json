            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 11.48, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate adjustment to 0.48 allows for some hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A balanced approach is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 14, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 23.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This value reflects a balance that avoids overhunting while still allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for moderate hunting without risking depletion. This balance will help maintain both the sheep and wolf populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for growth. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.10, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate increase to 0.45 maintains a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
