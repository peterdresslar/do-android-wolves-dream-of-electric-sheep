            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate intensity will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring our wolf pack can thrive. It is important to avoid overhunting as the sheep are still recovering, and this theta allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 1.19, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.72, which is only 22.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to gradually increase in number. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 44.98, which is only 18.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for more hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations. It reflects a cautious approach to increase hunting as the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.90, which is only 14.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, allowing both populations to stabilize without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 29.18, which is only 11.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 65, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.44, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.41, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.66, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.39, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.96, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.90, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.22, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.75, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.56, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach to hunting without depleting the sheep further, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.52, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring that we can sustain ourselves in the future.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.67, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing for a gradual adjustment to the wolf population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem."
