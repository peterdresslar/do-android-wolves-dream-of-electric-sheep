            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is relatively small. A moderate increase in hunting will help maintain our numbers while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overexploitation, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase will help sustain our pack while allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 28, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 2.20, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while keeping the long-term survival of both species in mind.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (28.4% of maximum capacity), which suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both sheep and wolves while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, promoting wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting focus, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for sheep recovery while also ensuring the wolf population remains stable. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking depletion of the sheep."
