            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 12.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta allows for continued reproduction while maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably without risking depletion or overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. A moderate increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 43.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 4.56, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 101.59, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability, while also being cautious not to over-deplete the sheep population. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 44.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling both sheep and wolves to thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 81.35, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 51.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance as the sheep recover, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.6% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is also significant, and I want to ensure sustainable coexistence while allowing for gradual recovery of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 64, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low, indicating competition among wolves is a concern. A theta of 0.35 allows for a focus on competition while still enabling some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. By gradually adjusting my hunting intensity, I can help ensure both populations remain sustainable in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 58, it"
