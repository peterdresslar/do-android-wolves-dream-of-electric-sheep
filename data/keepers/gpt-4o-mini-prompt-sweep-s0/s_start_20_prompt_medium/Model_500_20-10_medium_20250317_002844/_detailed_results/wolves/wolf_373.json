This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help balance our competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.
