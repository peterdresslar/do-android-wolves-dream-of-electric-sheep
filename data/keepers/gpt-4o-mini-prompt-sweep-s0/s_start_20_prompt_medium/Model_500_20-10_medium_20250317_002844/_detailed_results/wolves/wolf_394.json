            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.46, a moderate hunting intensity will allow for a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a healthy sheep population. This approach supports long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This balance will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious approach, balancing the need to maintain my wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting coexistence without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own wolf population. A lower theta value will help us compete with other wolves and stabilize our numbers without depleting the sheep further. Gradually adjusting to a more moderate hunting intensity will promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.32, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I should increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.74, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.02, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
