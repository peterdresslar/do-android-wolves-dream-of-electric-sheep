            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase in hunting intensity aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and promotes sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population is recovering, while also keeping an eye on the growing wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, I need to be cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves to ensure our population remains stable while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to maintain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with the wolf population at 53, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to rebound. A gradual approach is essential to ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.22, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both populations."
