This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.350 to 0.40, I can maintain a balanced strategy that allows for some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
