            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, given the current wolf population and the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep, a moderate approach is necessary. This theta allows for some hunting while also enabling the sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep sustainability, while also considering the gradual growth of the wolf population. A theta of 0.45 reflects a cautious yet proactive approach to ensure both species can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure sustainability, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we can afford to hunt a bit more without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while there is room to increase hunting intensity, it is important to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight reduction in hunting will allow for better competition among wolves and help maintain a healthy balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with the wolf population at 67.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A small increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population, allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.22, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for food with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population further."
