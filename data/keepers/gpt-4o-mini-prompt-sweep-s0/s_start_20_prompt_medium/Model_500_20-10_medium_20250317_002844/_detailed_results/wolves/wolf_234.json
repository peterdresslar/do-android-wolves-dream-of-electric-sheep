To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a gradual increase to 0.25 will help balance the ecosystem without overwhelming the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 29.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still enabling sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. By raising theta to 0.40, I can begin to take advantage of the sheep population without depleting it too quickly, ensuring a sustainable balance as the wolf population is also significant.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.24, which is only 9.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to bounce back. Additionally, with a wolf population of 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.70, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.10, which is only 8.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack remains sustainable in the long term. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",

By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",

This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to avoid sudden changes and promote long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.10, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and while I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover.

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.50, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
