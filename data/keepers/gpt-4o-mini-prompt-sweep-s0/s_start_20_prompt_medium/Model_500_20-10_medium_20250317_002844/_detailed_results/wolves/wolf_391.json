            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a low previous theta of 0.016, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure a sustainable balance. A theta of 0.25 allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both sheep and wolves. This adjustment reflects a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence as the sheep population is recovering.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid sudden changes, a gradual increase is the most prudent approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 57, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase will help ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.32, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be cautiously increased to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and promote sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.74, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still considering the need for wolves to thrive."
