            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.45, it is wise to maintain a balanced approach to ensure the sustainability of both populations. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the potential growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensure long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 33, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while avoiding overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, the wolf population is relatively high, and I need to be cautious to avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while still maintaining enough resources for the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 59.81, which is only 23.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some sheep recovery while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 19.50, which is only 7.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It reflects a gradual adjustment to the current low sheep numbers and the growing wolf population."
