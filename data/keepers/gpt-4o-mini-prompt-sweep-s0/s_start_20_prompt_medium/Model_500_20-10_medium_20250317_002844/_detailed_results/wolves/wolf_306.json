            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 27.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 61.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 54.47, which is only 21.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 43.24, which is only 17.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.63, which is only 14.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.77, which is only 11.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 24.49, which is only 9.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.02, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.81, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction, but it remains cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.41, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability while still allowing for some reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time.",

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.86, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a moderate approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance is crucial for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.80, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity.
