            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 23.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A moderate increase in theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 30, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high, suggesting that we should not overhunt. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep. A gradual increase will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, while also considering the current wolf population and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population is still recovering, while also considering the growing wolf population. A gradual approach ensures we adapt to the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves. This moderate theta allows for a balance that supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
