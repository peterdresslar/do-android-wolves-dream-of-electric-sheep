            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. A moderate theta value of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, thus fostering a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to rebuild their numbers while preventing overhunting. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still support the wolf population",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.07, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 6.8% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, encouraging sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",

This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while being mindful of their low numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.23, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.95, which is only 7.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",

This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
