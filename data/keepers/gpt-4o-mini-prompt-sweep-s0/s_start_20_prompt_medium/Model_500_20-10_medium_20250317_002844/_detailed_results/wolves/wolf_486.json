            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need for gradual adjustments, a theta of 0.35 supports coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.40 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach to hunting while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden crashes in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.48, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This small adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance between our populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.23, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.24, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 39, I need to ensure that we maintain our numbers as well. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.66, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population has a chance to bounce back while also allowing for a gradual adjustment in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.16, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize.",

This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.32, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep can recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can focus on a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.61, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.02, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to take advantage of the current sheep numbers without depleting them too quickly. This moderate adjustment allows for a sustainable balance as both populations can recover.",

This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover.
