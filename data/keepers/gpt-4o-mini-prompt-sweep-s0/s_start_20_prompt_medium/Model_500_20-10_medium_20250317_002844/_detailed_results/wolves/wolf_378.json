            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for a healthy wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and thrive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 20, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive without being overhunted. A moderate increase to 0.55 reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt them as the wolf population is also growing. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still providing enough food for the wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is more effective than a sudden change, ensuring a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate hunting intensity will allow us to maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species without risking a depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support the wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 32.32, which is only 12.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.4 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for the sheep to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that the wolf population remains healthy without depleting the sheep too quickly."
