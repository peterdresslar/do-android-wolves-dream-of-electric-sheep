This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I need to be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for some hunting while still promoting the recovery of the sheep and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.72, which is only 18.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 35.42, which is only 14.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.82, which is only 11.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.15, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a more sustainable balance.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.52, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to maintain balance.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a scarcity of prey. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves.
