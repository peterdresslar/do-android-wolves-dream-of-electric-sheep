            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance will support long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also present, I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and risk depleting the sheep. A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 27, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.98, I want to ensure that I maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. A gradual increase is prudent, considering the current dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A lower theta will allow for competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.16, which is only 19.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.10, which is only 16.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that encourages sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.35, which is only 13.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.23, which is only 11.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
