            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population. It reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 37.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep than wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance our immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance helps maintain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolves can thrive, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.51, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. A theta of 0.40 allows for a moderate approach, balancing the need to hunt for sustenance while also giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.48, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence while being mindful of the current low sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.23, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.24, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
