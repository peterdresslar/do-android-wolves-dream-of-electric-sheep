            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can maintain a sustainable hunting intensity while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This moderate theta allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can afford to maintain a sustainable hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while also allowing the sheep population to recover. This adjustment reflects a cautious strategy that promotes coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 18, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 46.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 30, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment helps maintain balance without risking depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.24, which is only 21.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, I should do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight decrease in theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without risking the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. It also reflects the growing wolf population, which necessitates a slight reduction in hunting intensity to maintain balance."
