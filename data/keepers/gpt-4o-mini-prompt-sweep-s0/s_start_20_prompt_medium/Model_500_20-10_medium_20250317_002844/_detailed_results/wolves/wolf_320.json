            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio and a previous theta of 0.256, a gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for healthy reproduction while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 45.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover without depleting their numbers too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This moderate adjustment will help prevent overhunting and allow for gradual recovery if needed.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious response to the growing wolf population while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while it is beneficial to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate adjustment allows for a balance that promotes coexistence while still enabling wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 helps maintain balance and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without risking immediate wolf competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem while still allowing for some competition among wolves."
