            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.10, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep recover, while also ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually increasing theta will support wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (22.6% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are fewer sheep available per wolf. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 45.49, which is only 18.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.08, which is only 14.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.79, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.88, which is only 10.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which is necessary given the current wolf population of 58. This approach helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.00, which is only 9.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.83, which is only 8.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.29, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the sheep population stabilizes while also allowing the wolf population to adjust gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.44, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.03, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.82, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.05, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover.
