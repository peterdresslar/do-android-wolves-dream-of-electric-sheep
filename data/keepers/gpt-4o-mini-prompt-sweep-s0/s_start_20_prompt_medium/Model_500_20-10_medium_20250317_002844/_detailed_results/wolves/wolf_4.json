            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.00, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value balances the need to sustain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a cautious approach, considering the current dynamics and aiming for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.01, which is only 8.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.55 strikes a balance between hunting to support our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.09, which is only 8.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, a moderate approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a theta of 0.50, I can balance hunting with the need to ensure both populations remain sustainable, avoiding overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.35, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring the sheep can recover and the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. By setting a slightly lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.53, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions while keeping an eye on the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.36, which is only 12.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta of 0.45 will help balance competition with other wolves and ensure sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.1% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover."
