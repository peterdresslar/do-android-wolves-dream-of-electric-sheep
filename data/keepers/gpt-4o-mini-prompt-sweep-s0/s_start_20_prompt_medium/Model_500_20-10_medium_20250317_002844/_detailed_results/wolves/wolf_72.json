            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. Gradually increasing theta will support wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This moderate approach balances the needs of both species and avoids depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 10, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Gradually adjusting towards a higher theta will enable us to respond to the increasing sheep numbers without risking over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both the sheep and wolf populations. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to hunt effectively while also considering the need for sheep recovery and the potential growth of our own wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize our pack while still allowing the sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance in the ecosystem. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach. This moderate hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. It is important to avoid overhunting at this stage to prevent future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population. It allows for gradual adaptation to the current conditions, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.45, I need to ensure that my hunting intensity remains moderate to allow for sustainable coexistence while also considering the growth of the wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta will help maintain balance and promote recovery in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual increase aligns with the current dynamics and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to ensure our survival. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This adjustment aims to support both the wolf population and the sheep"
