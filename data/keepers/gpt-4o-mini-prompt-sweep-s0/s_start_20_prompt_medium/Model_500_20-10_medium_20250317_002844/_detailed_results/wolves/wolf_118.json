            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this balance supports long-term coexistence.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.45 to 0.40 allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for wolf population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta value of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.92, which is only 7.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable environment. By keeping the hunting intensity lower, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both the sheep and the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.93, which is only 6.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.35, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.98, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep population while allowing for a gradual recovery. This approach balances the need for wolf reproduction with the sustainability of the sheep population.",
