This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 56.94, which is only 22.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 strikes a balance between hunting intensity and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 46.35, which is only 18.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep to gradually recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 37.17, which is only 14.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 66, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is already low, indicating that competition among wolves is increasing. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight focus on hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 30.87, which is only 12.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about overhunting, a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to support wolf reproduction. A theta of 0.40 allows for a gradual increase in hunting while still prioritizing the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 25.47, which is only 10.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on coexistence and sustainability, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.26, which is only 8.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and gradual adjustments based on current conditions.",

A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.25, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.78, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.49, which is only 6.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
