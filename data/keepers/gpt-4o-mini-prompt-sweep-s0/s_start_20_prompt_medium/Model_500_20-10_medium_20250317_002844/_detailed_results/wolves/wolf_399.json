        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.46, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the competition with other wolves, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta of 0.25 suggests a cautious approach. By increasing it slightly to 0.30, I can focus on maintaining a balance that allows for some hunting while still enabling the sheep population to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding any drastic impacts on either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 31.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 57.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 50.18, which is only 20.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it is crucial to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term sustainability. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to rebound, maintaining a balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 40.14, which is only 16.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.72, which is only 10.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 22.54, which is only 9.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable sheep population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.74, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.65, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 15.88, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment that respects the delicate balance of the ecosystem."
