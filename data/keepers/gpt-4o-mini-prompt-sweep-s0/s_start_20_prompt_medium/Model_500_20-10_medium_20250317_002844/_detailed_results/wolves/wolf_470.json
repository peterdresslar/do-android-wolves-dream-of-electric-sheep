            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 41.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with a wolf population of 38, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 2.73, suggesting that if I increase hunting intensity too much, it could lead to a depletion of the sheep population. A theta of 0.30 allows for a focus on competition among wolves while still enabling the sheep to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 37.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. It",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 42.37, which is only 16.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 34.14, which is only 13.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while there is an opportunity to hunt, it is crucial to avoid overexploitation to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 27.45, which is only 11.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.16, which is only 9.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.47, which is only 8.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta value will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, which is essential for maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.24, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability for both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.66, which is only 6.3% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.27, which is only 6.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover.
