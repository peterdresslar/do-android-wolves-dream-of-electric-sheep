            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 52.40, which is only 21.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 41.56, which is only 16.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 33.58, which is only 13.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery in the sheep population while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 28.02, which is only 11.2% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 23.75, which is only 9.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.20, which is only 8.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to sustain themselves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.22, which is only 7.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",

By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while avoiding overhunting. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.35, which is only 6.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.88, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.89, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize while preventing overhunting.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.42, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta only modestly, I can still focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.85, which is only 6.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.49, which is only 7.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.40, I can take advantage of the sheep",
