However, I must remain cautious and avoid drastic changes, as the wolf population is still relatively low. A moderate increase in hunting will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 22, I need to be cautious and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",

With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain the sheep population while still supporting the wolf pack",

A theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash.",

A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
