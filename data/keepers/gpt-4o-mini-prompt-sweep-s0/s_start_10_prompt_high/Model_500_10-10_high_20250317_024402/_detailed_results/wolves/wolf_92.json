            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. A moderate approach will allow for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is unfavorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still being mindful of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.40, it indicates that we need to be cautious in our hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support our population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain balance without causing sudden population crashes."
