            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become too depleted. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach helps balance the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population.

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover.
