            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, which suggests we can support more hunting without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.97, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This moderate approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance as the wolf population is moderately high, ensuring that both species can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual adjustment will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. Given the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments in response to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still considering the need for balance. This adjustment will help maintain the sheep population and prevent overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This cautious approach aims to ensure long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the goal of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on maintaining our numbers. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition, ensuring a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain itself. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating a need for caution. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining the wolf population"
