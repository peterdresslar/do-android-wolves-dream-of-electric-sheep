This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring that the sheep population can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 42.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the moderately high wolf population, a gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, so I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining enough hunting to support our own population. A gradual adjustment to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both current conditions and long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for better reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
