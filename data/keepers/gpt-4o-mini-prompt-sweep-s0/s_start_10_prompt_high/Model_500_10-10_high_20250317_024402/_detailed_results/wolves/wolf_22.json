A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 21, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without overly depleting the sheep population, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. Given the moderate wolf population, a small reduction in hunting will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still recovering, and while the wolf population is high, I need to ensure we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is prudent to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. A lower theta will allow sheep to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition.

This approach supports long-term sustainability and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
