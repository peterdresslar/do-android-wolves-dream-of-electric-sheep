            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a balanced approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while ensuring our pack thrives.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 39.4% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, it is crucial to avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A theta of 0.60 reflects a sustainable approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is also at a sustainable level, so a moderate hunting intensity will allow for coexistence while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This adjustment helps maintain balance and supports both populations in the long term.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and a lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while we focus on reducing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
