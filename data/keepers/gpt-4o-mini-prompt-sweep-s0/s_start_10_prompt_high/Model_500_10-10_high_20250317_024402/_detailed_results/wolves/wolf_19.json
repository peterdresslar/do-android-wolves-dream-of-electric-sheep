A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population.",

However, with a wolf population of 21, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment maintains a balance as the wolf population is moderately high, ensuring sustainable coexistence.",

A moderate decrease in hunting intensity allows for a balance that supports both wolf and sheep populations, especially as the wolf population is moderately high.",

The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on our own survival.
