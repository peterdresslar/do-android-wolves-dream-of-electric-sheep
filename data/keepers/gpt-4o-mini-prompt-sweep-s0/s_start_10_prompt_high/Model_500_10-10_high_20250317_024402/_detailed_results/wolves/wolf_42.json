            "I chose this theta because the current sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, and the wolf population is quite high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is relatively high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the balance needed for both populations to thrive. This gradual adjustment helps avoid over-depletion of sheep and maintains a healthy ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help balance the populations without depleting the sheep too quickly. This gradual adjustment allows for a more sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition among wolves is likely to increase. By focusing on lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance in the wolf population. This cautious approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability.",
