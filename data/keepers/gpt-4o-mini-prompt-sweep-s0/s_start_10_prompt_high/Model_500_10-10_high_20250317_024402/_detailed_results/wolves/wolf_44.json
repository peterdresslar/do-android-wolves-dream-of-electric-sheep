The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, which suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 34.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the competition among wolves.",
