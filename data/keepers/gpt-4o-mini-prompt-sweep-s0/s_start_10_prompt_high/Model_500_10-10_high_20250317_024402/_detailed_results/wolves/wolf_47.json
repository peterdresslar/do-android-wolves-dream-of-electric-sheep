By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase their numbers. This aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low at 22.5% of maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which will help the sheep recover while maintaining our own population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and a cautious approach is necessary to allow their numbers to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to rebound, which is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
