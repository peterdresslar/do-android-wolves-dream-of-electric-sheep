            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while also considering the high wolf population. This adjustment aims to maintain a sustainable balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. A moderate hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while giving sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment balances the needs of both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly, allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species and promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is likely to increase. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and with a high wolf population, competition is increasing. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta allows for more focus on competition, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term sustainability.",
