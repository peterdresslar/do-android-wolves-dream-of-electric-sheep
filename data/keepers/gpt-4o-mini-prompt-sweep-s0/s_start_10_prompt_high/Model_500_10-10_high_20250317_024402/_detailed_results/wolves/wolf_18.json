            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for more intense hunting without risking their long-term survival. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 10.05, the ecosystem can support increased hunting, which will help sustain the wolf population. However, I will adjust gradually to avoid sudden changes that could destabilize the balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover. A moderate increase will help maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 21, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. Gradually adjusting to a moderate hunting intensity will support sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps maintain our wolf population without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep population to recover. By lowering the hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among us. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population to prevent overcompetition. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for better reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance without risking a crash.",

The sheep population is at 31.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing the competition among wolves. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while reducing the pressure on our own population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",

A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
