            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight reduction in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep. Given the current wolf population is moderately high, a gradual decrease in hunting will support the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. The sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable, indicating that we need to focus on reducing our hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition among wolves. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio becoming less favorable, it is wise to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. The sheep population is at a sustainable level, but to ensure long-term survival and allow for recovery, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is currently high, leading to increased competition. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This balance will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta will allow for more competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is crucial for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low relative to the wolf population, indicating a need for caution in hunting to allow sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving sheep a chance to stabilize and grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while we manage our numbers more sustainably. This gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",

A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we focus on maintaining our own population stability.",
