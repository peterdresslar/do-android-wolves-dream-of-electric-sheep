A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain our wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 32.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high sheep-to-wolf ratio of 3.71, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the wolf population is moderately high, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while still enabling wolves to maintain their numbers. This approach supports a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is moderately high. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolves to maintain a healthy population. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids drastic changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable.
