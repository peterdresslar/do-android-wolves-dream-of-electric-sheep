A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment aims to maintain a balance that supports the recovery of the sheep population without overwhelming it.",
