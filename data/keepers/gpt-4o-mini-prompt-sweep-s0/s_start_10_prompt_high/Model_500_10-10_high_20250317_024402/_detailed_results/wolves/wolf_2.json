This cautious approach aligns with the need for long-term sustainability and avoids depleting the sheep further.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also focusing on competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and while I want to allow for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must prioritize the sustainability of the sheep population. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further."
