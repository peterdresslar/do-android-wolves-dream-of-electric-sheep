However, with the wolf population also being high, I need to be cautious to avoid overcompetition. A slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while still allowing for reproduction.",

This value reflects a balanced approach, considering the high wolf population and the need for sustainable coexistence.",

A lower theta allows for a focus on reducing competition and giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is concerningly low, and the wolf population is high, leading to increased competition. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the current sheep population is low and the wolf population is high, indicating increased competition among wolves. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, allowing their numbers to recover while we manage our own population dynamics more sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate approach will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This gradual adjustment helps ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is concerningly low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A lower theta will allow the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. Gradual adjustments are key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is becoming less favorable. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence."
