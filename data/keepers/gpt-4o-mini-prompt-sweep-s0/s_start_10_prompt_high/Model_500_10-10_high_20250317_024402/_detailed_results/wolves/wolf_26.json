However, the wolf population is moderately high, so a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term survival of both species.",

This balance is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further and to ensure long-term survival for both species.",
