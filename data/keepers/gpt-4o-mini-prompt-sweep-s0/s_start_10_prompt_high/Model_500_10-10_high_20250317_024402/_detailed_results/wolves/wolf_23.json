A theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting.",

This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while allowing for some recovery in the sheep population. Given the moderately high wolf population, it",

A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem.",

This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",

A slight increase in hunting intensity allows for some reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
