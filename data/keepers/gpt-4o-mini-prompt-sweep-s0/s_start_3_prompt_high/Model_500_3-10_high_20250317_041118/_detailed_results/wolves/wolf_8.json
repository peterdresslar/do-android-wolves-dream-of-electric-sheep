This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",

By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves.

With the wolf population also being relatively low, focusing on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting will help maintain balance and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
