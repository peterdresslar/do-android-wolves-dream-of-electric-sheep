            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to increase hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while also addressing the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help stabilize both populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual recovery of the sheep population and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.04, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A theta of 0.30 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while prioritizing competition with other wolves, which helps stabilize the wolf population without further depleting the already vulnerable sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A theta of 0.30 allows me to focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population."
