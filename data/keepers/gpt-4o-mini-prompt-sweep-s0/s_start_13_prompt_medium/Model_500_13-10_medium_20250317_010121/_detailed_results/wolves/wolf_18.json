This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. This approach aligns with the need for balance, considering both the current state and the trends in the populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase in hunting intensity from my previous theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance, but I will avoid drastic changes to prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a balance with the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and support the sheep"
