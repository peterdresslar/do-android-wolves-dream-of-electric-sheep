            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while ensuring that our wolf pack does not overhunt and face future scarcity. A gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.25 to 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still considering the needs of the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting, promoting sustainability without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining the health of my pack. This gradual approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports the recovery of the sheep while still considering the needs of the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.79, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta allows for a focus on competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still being cautious about the wolf population growth. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover while ensuring our own population remains stable. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevents a potential crash in the ecosystem."
