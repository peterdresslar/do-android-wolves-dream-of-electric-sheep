            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to focus on competition among wolves to prevent overhunting and allow the sheep to recover. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. By slightly increasing theta from my previous value, I can still maintain some hunting to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.04. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of sheep population recovery."
