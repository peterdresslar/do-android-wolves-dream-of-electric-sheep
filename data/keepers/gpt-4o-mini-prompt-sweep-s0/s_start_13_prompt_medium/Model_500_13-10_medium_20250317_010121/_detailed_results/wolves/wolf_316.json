            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 141, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. This balance will help sustain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.31, which is just 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment will allow for a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. A lower theta allows for more focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.25 was already focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population by reducing my hunting intensity further. This will allow the sheep to rebound while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.20 allows for a gradual adjustment while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",

A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further."
