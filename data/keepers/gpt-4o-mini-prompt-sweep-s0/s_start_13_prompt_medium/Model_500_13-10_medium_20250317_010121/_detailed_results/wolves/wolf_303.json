            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition among wolves. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the current high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 is warranted to adapt to the current conditions and encourage a gradual balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.79, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the remaining sheep too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and eventually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
