            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 161.88, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. A theta of 0.75 strikes a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 93, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and supports a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations."
