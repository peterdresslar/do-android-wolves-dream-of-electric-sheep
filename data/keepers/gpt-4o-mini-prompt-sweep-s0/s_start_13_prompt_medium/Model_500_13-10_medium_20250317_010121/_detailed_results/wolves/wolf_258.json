            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is relatively high, so a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual adaptation to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 141, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should prioritize the recovery of the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own health. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking the depletion of sheep, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase in numbers, while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to gradually increase their numbers. By slightly increasing theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
