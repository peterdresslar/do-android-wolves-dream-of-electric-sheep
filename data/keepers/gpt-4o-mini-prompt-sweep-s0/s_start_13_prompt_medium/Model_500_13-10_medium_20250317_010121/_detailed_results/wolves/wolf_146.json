            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta of 0.240 suggests a need for gradual adjustment. By increasing to 0.30, I can focus slightly more on hunting while still allowing for the sheep population to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid sudden changes, a gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach is prudent.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",

This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow for recovery. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity, it could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover, I can afford to increase my hunting slightly from my previous theta of 0.30. A theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will help maintain the sheep population while also allowing for gradual adjustments in the future as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balanced approach that allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance."
