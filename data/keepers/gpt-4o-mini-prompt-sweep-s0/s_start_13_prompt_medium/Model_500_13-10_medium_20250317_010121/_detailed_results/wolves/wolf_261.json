            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize while still ensuring that my pack remains healthy. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 is warranted to account for the gradual increase in competition among wolves, as the wolf population is relatively high at 107. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.79, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 93, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low, indicating a high risk of depleting the sheep further if hunting intensity is increased. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
