            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being 4.02, there is still a healthy number of sheep available, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing. A theta of 0.4 allows for some hunting to support reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and remain sustainable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making gradual changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep to gradually increase in number while ensuring our own population remains stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 64, the competition among wolves is high, and a lower theta will help stabilize our numbers while giving sheep a chance to rebound."
