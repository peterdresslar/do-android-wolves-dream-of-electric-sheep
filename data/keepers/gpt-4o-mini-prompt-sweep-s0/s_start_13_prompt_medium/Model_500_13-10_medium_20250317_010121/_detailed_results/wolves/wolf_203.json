However, with a low wolf population of 6, I need to focus on competition with other wolves to ensure our survival. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sheep to recover while also maintaining our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still promoting sustainability. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a slight decrease in hunting intensity to promote sustainability. This will help ensure that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual adjustment will also allow us to adapt to future changes in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of adapting to current conditions and trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover, as the current sheep-to-wolf ratio suggests a healthy balance. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of small changes for long-term stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This balance will help sustain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
