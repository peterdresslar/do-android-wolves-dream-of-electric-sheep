            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 141, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent future crashes. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This strategy helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a crash in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and avoiding sudden changes, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our own numbers. This gradual approach is essential for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By focusing on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring our wolf population remains stable. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity. Increasing hunting intensity could lead to a further decline in sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term food source. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very low at 2.27, which is only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support our population growth. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase their numbers while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.94, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.05, it is essential to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to ensure long-term survival for both species. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
