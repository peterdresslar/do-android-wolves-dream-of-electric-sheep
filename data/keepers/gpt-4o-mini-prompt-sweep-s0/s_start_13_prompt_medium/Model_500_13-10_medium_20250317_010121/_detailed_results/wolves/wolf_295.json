            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.11, it is essential to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our population remains stable. A gradual increase in theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population if I focus less on hunting and more on competing with other wolves. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a gradual adjustment while still considering the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.18. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring both our survival and that of the sheep in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also ensuring that our wolf pack does not deplete its primary food source. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding further depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.04, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a low hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and ensures the long-term survival of both species. Given the current high wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition among wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species."
