            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 69.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not deplete too quickly. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem as both populations continue to fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to hunting, acknowledging the need to balance wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, it is essential to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This approach will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance."
