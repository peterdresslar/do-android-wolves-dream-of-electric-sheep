            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious response to the growing wolf population, ensuring sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help sustain both populations without risking depletion, as the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates there are enough sheep to support a moderate increase in hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling both populations to recover while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for hunting with the importance of not depleting the sheep further."
