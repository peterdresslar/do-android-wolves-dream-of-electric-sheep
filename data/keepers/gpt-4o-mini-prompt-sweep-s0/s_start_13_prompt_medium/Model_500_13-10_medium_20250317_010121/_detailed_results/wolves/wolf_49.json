            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.57, it is wise to focus more on competing with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our own numbers remain stable. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 63.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competing with other wolves, which will help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and maintaining a balance with the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still prioritizing the long-term balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.22. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
