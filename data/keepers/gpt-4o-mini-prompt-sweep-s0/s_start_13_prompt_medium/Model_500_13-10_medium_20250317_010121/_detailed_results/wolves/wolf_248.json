            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with the wolf population at 75, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.25 allows for a cautious approach, promoting coexistence and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a cautious approach. This adjustment aims to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting. This theta value reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing over-competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for hunting with the necessity of ensuring the sheep population can grow. This adjustment allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the competitive dynamics with other wolves."
