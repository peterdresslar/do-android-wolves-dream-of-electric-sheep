            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, I need to be cautious to avoid overhunting. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a sustainable coexistence while being cautious not to overhunt as the wolf population is relatively high. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will support sustainable coexistence in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while being mindful of their low numbers. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help reduce our own population pressure while allowing the sheep to bounce back. A lower theta will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since my previous theta was 0.300, a slight increase to 0.35 allows for a gradual adjustment while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before intensifying our hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the long-term health of both populations."
