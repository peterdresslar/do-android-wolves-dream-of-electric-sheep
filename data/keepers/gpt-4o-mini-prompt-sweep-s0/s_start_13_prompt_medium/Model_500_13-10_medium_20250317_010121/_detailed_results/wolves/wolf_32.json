            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 63, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some reproduction among the wolves. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting. A moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.350, I can maintain a balance that supports the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to rebound. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
