            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was quite low as well. By setting it to 0.3, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.59, which is only 5.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that allows for some hunting while still giving the sheep a chance to grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.32, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I should increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must do so cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still recognizing the need for wolves to thrive."
