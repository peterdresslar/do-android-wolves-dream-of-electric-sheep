This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.94, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help reduce pressure on the sheep and give them a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.93, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.01, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.09, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.16. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",

By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.29. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, enabling me to hunt a bit more while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.97, which is only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.21, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction, but not so much that it depletes the sheep further. This approach promotes a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting.
