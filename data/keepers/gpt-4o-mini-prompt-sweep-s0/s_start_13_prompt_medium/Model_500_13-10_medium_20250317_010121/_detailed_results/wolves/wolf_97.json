However, with the wolf population being low, I need to ensure that we can sustain our numbers while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase in hunting will help balance our needs and the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",

This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly, considering the current wolf population is low.",

This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, a moderate theta will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring that the wolf pack remains healthy and can adapt to future changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also growing, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep. This moderate approach supports sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and to ensure sustainable coexistence, I need to balance hunting intensity with the need to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to ensure wolf reproduction. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to avoid overexploitation, a slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain stability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 93, I need to be cautious about overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing our need for food with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be increased slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring sustainability without depleting the sheep too quickly."
