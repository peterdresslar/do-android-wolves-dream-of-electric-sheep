            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while also ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing sustainability. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to maintain my hunting to support the wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem and promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also focusing on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize the wolf population and give the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep, while also addressing the current high wolf population."
