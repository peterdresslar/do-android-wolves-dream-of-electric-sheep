        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because it allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the balance between wolf and sheep populations. Given that the sheep population is at 49% of its maximum capacity, a slight increase in hunting can help sustain wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This moderate approach will help the sheep recover while keeping our wolf population stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to stabilize. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. Maintaining a lower theta allows for the sheep to recover while also keeping the wolf population stable. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
