            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that we can thrive without depleting our prey too quickly. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining harmony in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while still enabling the sheep to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between both populations, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to increase my hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still providing enough resources for the wolf population to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This moderate decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep population stabilize while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Given the current wolf population of 72, maintaining a lower theta will help ensure that we do not deplete the sheep further while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
