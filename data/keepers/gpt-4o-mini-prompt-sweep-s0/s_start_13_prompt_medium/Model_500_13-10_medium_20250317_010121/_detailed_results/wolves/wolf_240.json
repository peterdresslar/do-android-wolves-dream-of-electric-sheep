            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I want to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a viable sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my theta to 0.55, I can intensify my hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover and maintain balance. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of adapting to population changes without causing sudden disruptions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 141, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for wolves to compete and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to increase in number, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for sustainable hunting. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species."
