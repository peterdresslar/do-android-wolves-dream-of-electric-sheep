            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overhunting, as the sheep population is still recovering. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 161.88, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This adjustment reflects a gradual decrease from my previous theta, acknowledging the growing wolf population and the need for balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, maintaining a balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 73, I must also be cautious to avoid overhunting, which could lead to future scarcity. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach balances the need for food with the long-term health of both populations, avoiding overhunting while still allowing for some growth in the wolf pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a higher hunting intensity. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations."
