            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This adjustment is gradual, responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a scarcity of food. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a theta of 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize without depleting their numbers further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the needs of both species without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
