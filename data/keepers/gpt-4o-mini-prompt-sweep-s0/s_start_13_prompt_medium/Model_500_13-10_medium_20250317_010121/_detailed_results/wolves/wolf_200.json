            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.5% of maximum capacity, which indicates a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a wolf population of 6, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high at 32.28, suggesting that I should not over-hunt to allow for sustainable coexistence. A moderate theta of 0.50 allows for balanced hunting while also considering the need to maintain the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 206.20, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. A moderate increase to 0.55 reflects a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being significant, I want to ensure we don",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 141, it's important to avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still maintaining a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our needs without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem."
