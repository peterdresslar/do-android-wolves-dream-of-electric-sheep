            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with a wolf population of 141, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species, ensuring sustainable coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting activity while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This will help create a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and a slight increase in hunting intensity is necessary to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment balances our need for food with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable future for both species. Gradual adjustments are key to maintaining balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for our survival.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",

To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.96, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover.
