This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population does not decline too rapidly. This balance will help maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 206.20, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem as we adapt to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population. A moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf sustainability. This adjustment helps avoid overhunting while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
