        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 69.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I want to avoid overexploitation and ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the potential growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This balance will help maintain both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 141, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a more balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while we focus on competing with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep."
