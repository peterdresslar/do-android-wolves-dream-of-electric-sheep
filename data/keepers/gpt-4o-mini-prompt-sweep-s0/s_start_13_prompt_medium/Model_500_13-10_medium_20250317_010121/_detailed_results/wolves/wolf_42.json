            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also growing, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This adjustment reflects the need to respond to the current sheep population while being cautious not to deplete their numbers too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance our hunting with the current sheep population, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I need to maintain a balance, I should not increase hunting intensity too much, as it could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population and preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving sheep a chance to increase. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the necessity of maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize."
