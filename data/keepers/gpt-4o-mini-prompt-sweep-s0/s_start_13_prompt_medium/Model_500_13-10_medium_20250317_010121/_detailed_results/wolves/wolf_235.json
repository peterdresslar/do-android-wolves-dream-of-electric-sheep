            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 206.20, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given that the sheep population is at 82.5% of its maximum capacity, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 2.31, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a balanced approach while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it is important to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help the sheep recover while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both sheep and wolves can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both species."
