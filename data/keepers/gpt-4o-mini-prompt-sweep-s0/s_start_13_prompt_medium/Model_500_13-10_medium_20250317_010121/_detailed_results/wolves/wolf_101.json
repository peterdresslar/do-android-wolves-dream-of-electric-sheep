            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach to coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 13, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This value reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is relatively low. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will help maintain stability in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 161.88, and the current sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are enough sheep to sustain the wolf population without overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow for better competition among wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment helps support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while ensuring that the sheep population can sustain itself. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a balanced approach will help maintain both populations without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow for better coexistence and prevent over-depletion of the sheep. This moderate approach will help maintain balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population growth. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further."
