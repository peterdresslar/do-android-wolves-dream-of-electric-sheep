            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable, and a lower hunting intensity will allow their numbers to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. By focusing on coexistence and gradual adjustments, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep population to recover while avoiding competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in sheep, jeopardizing both their survival and our long-term food source. By slightly increasing my theta to 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.05, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.94, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 0.05, hunting more aggressively would risk depleting the sheep further and jeopardizing both species"
