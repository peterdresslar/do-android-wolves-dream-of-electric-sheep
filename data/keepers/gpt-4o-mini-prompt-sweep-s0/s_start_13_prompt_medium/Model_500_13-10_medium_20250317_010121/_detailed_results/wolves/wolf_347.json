This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.3 to 0.25, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, which will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.59, which is only 1.0% of its maximum capacity.

A slight increase from my previous theta will help me balance hunting with the need to compete with other wolves, ensuring sustainability.",

By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining the health of our wolf pack. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 3.21, which is only 1.3% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a scarcity of prey. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help the sheep recover while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain the wolf population while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.
