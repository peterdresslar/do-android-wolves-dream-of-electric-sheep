            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, since the wolf population is also growing, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This adjustment will help maintain the health of the sheep population while ensuring that the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 104, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta of 0.300 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.15. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will help maintain our population while allowing the sheep to rebound. A gradual approach is essential to ensure long-term sustainability."
