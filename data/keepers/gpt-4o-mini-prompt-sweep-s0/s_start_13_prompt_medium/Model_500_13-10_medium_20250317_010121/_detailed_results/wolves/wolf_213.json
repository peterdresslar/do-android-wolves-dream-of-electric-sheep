            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 216.30, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid over-depletion of the sheep, maintaining a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 27, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure the sustainability of both species. A gradual increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, and I need to ensure that we do not overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, it is wise to adopt a more balanced approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.45 allows for moderate hunting while still considering the need for competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 141.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem."
