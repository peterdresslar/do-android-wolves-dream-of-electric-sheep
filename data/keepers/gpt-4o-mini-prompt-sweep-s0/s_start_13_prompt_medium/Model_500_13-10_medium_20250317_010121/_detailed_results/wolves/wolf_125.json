            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 38, I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help avoid sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while it is important to maintain a healthy wolf population, I need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help balance the ecosystem without causing a dramatic shift.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term health of both populations."
