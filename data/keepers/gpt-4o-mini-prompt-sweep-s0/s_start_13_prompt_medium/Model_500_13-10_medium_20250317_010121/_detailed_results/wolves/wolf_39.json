            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without over-depleting the sheep, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid over-depleting the sheep and to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain my pack while still considering the long-term balance with the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. A gradual increase in theta reflects the current sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep population to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep to regain their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and maintaining a lower hunting intensity will help ensure their survival while allowing the wolf population to stabilize. A gradual approach will help us avoid depleting the sheep further and create a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.350, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the need for my pack"
