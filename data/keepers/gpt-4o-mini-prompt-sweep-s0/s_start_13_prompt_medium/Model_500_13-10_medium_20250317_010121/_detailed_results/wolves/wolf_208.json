            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. It reflects a cautious strategy, allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a moderate increase in theta will help ensure that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate approach is necessary to prevent overhunting and ensure long-term coexistence. This value allows for a gradual increase in hunting intensity while still considering the health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (26.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition among wolves. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
