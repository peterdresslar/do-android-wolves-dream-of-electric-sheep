            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and maintain their numbers. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to maintain a healthy wolf population, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 strikes a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity for the sheep to recover if I reduce my hunting intensity. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a more sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.4 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring that both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers further. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep recover while maintaining our wolf population sustainably. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This approach helps maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain balance and prevent overhunting."
