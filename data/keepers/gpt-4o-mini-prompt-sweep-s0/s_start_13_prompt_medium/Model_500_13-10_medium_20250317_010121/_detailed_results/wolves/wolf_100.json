            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A theta of 0.6 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 59.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with 9 wolves in the pack, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite high, suggesting that we should not overhunt. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while ensuring that both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 62.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 13, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate intensity will help sustain both sheep and wolf populations, ensuring long-term survival while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This value supports sustainable coexistence, as it allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep population too quickly. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainability. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, which indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta of 0.450 allowed for some hunting, I need to slightly reduce my intensity to ensure that the sheep can recover and maintain a sustainable population. This adjustment will also help balance the wolf population as we adapt to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it"
