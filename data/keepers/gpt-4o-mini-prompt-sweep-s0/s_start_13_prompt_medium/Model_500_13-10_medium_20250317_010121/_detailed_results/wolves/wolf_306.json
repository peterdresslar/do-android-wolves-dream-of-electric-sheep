            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.11, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as it could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm our long-term survival. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.46, it is essential to maintain a balance that allows both populations to thrive. A moderate theta value will help ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep while avoiding sudden changes that could disrupt the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help the sheep population gradually increase while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while preventing over-competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.04. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, jeopardizing both species",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
