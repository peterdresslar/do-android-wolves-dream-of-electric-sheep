            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 141, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.7 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.50 strikes a balance between hunting intensity and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which would ultimately harm the wolf population as well.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should remain cautious to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help balance the need for wolf reproduction while still allowing sheep to regain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta of 0.3 was focused on competition with other wolves. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity to 0.35, allowing for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This small adjustment helps maintain a balance without overwhelming the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.04. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. A slight increase to 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for hunting with the necessity of sheep population recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.92, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to gradually increase while also managing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.01, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover.
