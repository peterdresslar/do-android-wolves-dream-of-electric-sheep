            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help balance the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some sustainable coexistence while still being cautious not to deplete their numbers further. A moderate approach will help maintain balance as the wolf population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than hunting will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual approach is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize and gradually increase, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining some level of hunting to support our pack. A gradual increase from my previous theta will help strike a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was focused on hunting. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to shift my focus towards competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.98, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for our survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.94, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 36, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was quite low as well. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting intensity, I will gradually increase my theta. This small adjustment will help ensure a balance between my needs and the sustainability of the ecosystem."
