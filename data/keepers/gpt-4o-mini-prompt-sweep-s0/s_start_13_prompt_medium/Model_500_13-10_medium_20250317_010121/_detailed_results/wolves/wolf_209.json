            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Additionally, with the wolf population at 16, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing our immediate needs.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population and maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 69.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between our needs and the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.11, a slight decrease in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still supporting the wolf population. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (26.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the declining sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some pressure on the sheep while being mindful of the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still allowing sheep to rebound."
