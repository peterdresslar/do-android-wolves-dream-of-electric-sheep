            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 102.18, allowing for some increased hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. However, I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, so I am making a moderate adjustment rather than a drastic one, ensuring a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (21.4% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations, as it encourages reproduction among wolves while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.450 to 0.35, I can focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase in numbers, promoting long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for sheep recovery while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also preventing overcompetition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to adapt to changing conditions."
