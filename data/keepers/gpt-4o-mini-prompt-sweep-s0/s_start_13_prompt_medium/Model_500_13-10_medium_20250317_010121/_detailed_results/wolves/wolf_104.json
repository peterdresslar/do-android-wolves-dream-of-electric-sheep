            "I chose this theta because it represents a balanced approach to hunting. The sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and while I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for gradual adjustments in response to both sheep and wolf populations, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and maintaining a sustainable sheep population, which is crucial for our long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain sustainability as the sheep population is recovering, while also considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and maintains balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A slight decrease in hunting intensity allows for the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. This moderate approach helps maintain balance and avoids over-depletion of the sheep, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.83, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to stabilize while avoiding overhunting. This moderate approach will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for wolves to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance within the wolf pack."
