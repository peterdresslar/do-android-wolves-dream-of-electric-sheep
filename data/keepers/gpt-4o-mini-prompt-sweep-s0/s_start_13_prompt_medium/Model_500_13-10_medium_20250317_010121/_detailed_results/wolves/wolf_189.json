            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This gradual adjustment will promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting coexistence and avoiding depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep, while also considering the current high wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments and ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a gradual balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.17. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and allowing for a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.21. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.40, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.58, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to adapt to the current conditions while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.77, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize while preventing overhunting. A lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.06, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for limited resources. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our own numbers. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 7.80, which is only 3.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting as the sheep population begins to stabilize."
