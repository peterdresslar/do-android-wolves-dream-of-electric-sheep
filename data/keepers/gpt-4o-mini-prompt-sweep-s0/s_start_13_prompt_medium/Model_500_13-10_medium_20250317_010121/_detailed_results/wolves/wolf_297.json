            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to focus on maintaining balance and preventing overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to allow for wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without risking a significant depletion of the sheep, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 5.31, which is just 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting but prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. By slightly increasing it, I can begin to focus on hunting while still allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual approach will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.04. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population"
