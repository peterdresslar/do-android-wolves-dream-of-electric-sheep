A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some hunting while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This approach helps maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.32, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.09, which is only 6.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of our own population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier ecosystem balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.05, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 17.17, which is only 6.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.43, which is only 7.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.78, which is only 7.9% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting without risking depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
