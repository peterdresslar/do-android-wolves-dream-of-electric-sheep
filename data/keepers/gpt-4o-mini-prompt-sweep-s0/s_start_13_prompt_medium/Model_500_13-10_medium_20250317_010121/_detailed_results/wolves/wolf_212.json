            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while ensuring that we do not over-deplete the sheep. A theta of 0.5 reflects a sustainable approach, allowing for both reproduction and recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the health of the ecosystem, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 206.20, which allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 75, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With the wolf population at 110, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure both species can thrive. A slight reduction in hunting intensity allows for a more sustainable balance while still enabling some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and maintain a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help balance the populations without causing a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while ensuring the sheep have a chance to increase, promoting long-term sustainability."
