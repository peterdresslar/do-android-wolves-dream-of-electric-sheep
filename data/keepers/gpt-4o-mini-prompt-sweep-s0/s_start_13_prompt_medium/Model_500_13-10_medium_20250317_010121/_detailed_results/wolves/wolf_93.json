To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A gradual increase in theta to 0.25 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate approach allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach to hunting while still considering the need to compete with other wolves. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction, but it remains cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",

To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.05, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.61, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow for a more sustainable environment for both species. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of the sheep while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.00, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 18.67, which is only 7.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate approach to hunting is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.
