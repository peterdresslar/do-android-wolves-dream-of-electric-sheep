            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.11, it is essential to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.12 to 0.25 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, since my previous theta was 0.300, I am making a small adjustment upwards to 0.35 to slightly increase hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.04. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population a chance to recover while ensuring our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
