            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 69.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually adjusting my hunting intensity will support sustainable coexistence as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction, I must be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By adopting a slightly higher theta than before, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
