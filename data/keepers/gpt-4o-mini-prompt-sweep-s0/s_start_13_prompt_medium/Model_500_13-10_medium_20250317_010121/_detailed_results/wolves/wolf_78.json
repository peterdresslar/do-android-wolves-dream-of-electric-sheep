            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, and this theta reflects a balanced approach.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase my hunting intensity, it is important to do so gradually to avoid depleting the sheep population further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling sustainable coexistence while still considering the growth of the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species. This adjustment allows for a gradual recovery of the sheep while still considering the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to ensure our own survival. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf and sheep populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to stabilize while preventing overhunting. A gradual approach is essential to ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.07, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.05, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.12, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.32, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure their long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in both populations."
