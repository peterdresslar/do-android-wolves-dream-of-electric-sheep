            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 63.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment will help maintain our population without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, considering both the need for wolves to thrive and the importance of allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.35 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 allows for some hunting but emphasizes competition with other wolves to ensure our long-term survival and a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their depletion. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our own population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.24. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem while allowing sheep numbers to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can grow, supporting long-term sustainability for both species."
