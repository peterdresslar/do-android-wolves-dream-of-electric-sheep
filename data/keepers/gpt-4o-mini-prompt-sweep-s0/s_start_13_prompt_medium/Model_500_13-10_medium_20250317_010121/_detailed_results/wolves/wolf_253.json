        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but my previous low theta indicates a need for gradual adjustment. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help support the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and maintain balance. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. This gradual increase in hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. Increasing theta slightly from 0.35 to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach that supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still being cautious about the sheep population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.30 will help balance the competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable ecosystem."
