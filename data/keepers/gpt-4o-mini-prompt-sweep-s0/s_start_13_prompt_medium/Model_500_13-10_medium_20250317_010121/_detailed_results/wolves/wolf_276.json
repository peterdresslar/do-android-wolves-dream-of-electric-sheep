            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. However, with the wolf population at 141, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower hunting intensity will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also reducing competition among wolves. This approach aligns with my objective of ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves will allow the sheep to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity is necessary to prevent further depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a rapid decline in the sheep population, jeopardizing the long-term survival of both species. By focusing on competition with other wolves and reducing hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population."
