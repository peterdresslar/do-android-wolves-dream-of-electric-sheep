            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.04, which is only 30.8% of its maximum capacity. Given the sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.83, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing for a more sustainable balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. By gradually increasing theta from 0.25 to 0.35, I can strike a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to help sustain wolf reproduction while still allowing for some recovery of the sheep population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a cautious approach to balance both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to sustain my pack, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance, ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before increasing our hunting intensity. A lower theta will help reduce competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by focusing on competition with other wolves rather than depleting the already scarce sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.40, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing the wolf population sustainably. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.58, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for food with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.77, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.06, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be kept relatively low to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach to balance the needs of my pack while still considering the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.39, which is only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while allowing the sheep population to stabilize."
