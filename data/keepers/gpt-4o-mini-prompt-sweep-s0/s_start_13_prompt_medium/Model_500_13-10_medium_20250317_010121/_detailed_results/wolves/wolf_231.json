            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This value reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without risking a dramatic depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (26.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still competing with other wolves. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species and maintains a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring our pack"
