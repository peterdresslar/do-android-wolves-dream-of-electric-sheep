            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, my previous theta of 0.175 suggests a need for a gradual increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction. By setting theta at 0.3, I aim for a balanced approach that allows for sustainable coexistence while still being cautious about not depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual increase aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but still below maximum capacity. A moderate approach allows for continued hunting while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for sustenance with the goal of long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep."
