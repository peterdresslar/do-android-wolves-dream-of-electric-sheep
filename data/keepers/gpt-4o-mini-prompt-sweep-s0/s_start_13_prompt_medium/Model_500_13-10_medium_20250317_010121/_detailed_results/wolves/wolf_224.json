            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking a rapid decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 69.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. A gradual adjustment towards a more sustainable coexistence is necessary as the wolf population is stable but could grow if we manage our hunting wisely.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in theta to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach to hunting while still considering the health of the sheep population and the need for wolf reproduction. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in response to changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that while I can increase hunting intensity, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while still considering the need for sheep recovery and maintaining a balance with the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while giving sheep a chance to recover, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and fostering a sustainable balance."
