            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need to avoid over-depleting the sheep population. A moderate adjustment keeps the balance dynamic and responsive to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate hunting intensity will help balance the needs of both species and promote sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, which is crucial for maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By slightly increasing theta to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.79, which is only 1.5% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to the depletion of sheep, threatening both their survival and the long-term health of our wolf pack. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.04. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A moderate theta will help balance my competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover and increases their population, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem. Given the current high wolf population, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than aggressive hunting."
