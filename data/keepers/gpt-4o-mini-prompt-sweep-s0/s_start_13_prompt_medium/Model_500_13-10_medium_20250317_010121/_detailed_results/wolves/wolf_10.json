            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with a low wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still ensuring their recovery. This value reflects a balanced approach, allowing for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population is relatively low. It also prepares for future adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, the wolf population is relatively low, so a moderate approach allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This value helps maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species. It allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. It reflects a balanced approach, responding to the current state of both populations without making drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with a wolf population of 25, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high at 5.68, suggesting that I should focus on maintaining balance rather than intensifying hunting. A slight decrease in theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for wolves to compete and stabilize their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt enough to support the wolf population while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta aligns with the current dynamics of the ecosystem, promoting coexistence without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can stabilize, promoting long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our own population health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help ensure the long-term survival of both species."
