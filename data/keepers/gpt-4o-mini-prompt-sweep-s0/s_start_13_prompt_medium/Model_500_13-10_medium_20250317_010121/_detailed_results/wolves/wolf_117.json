            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring both can thrive without depleting resources. A theta of 0.5 reflects a cautious yet proactive approach, promoting sustainability while adapting to the current ecosystem dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while still enabling sheep to recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it is wise to maintain a moderate hunting intensity to ensure we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while also allowing for some reproduction among wolves. This balance will help sustain both populations over the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help maintain both the sheep and wolf populations without risking depletion. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help ensure that we do not overhunt while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, focusing on coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with a wolf population of 104, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain some hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to ensure a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A moderate hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf pack to maintain its numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
