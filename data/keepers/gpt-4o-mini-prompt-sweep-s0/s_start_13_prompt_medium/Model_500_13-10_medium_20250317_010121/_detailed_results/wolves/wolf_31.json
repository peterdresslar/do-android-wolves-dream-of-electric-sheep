            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, responding to the current conditions without making drastic changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 54.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while preventing over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can sustain both populations. This value reflects a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep too quickly while still allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is crucial to avoid destabilizing the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more moderate hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. By setting theta at 0.45, I can balance the need for hunting with the importance of not depleting the sheep further, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also want to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species."
