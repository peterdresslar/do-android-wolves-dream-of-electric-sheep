            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 71.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity. However, with a low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 77.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population at 6.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in theta allows for sustainable hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 216.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 16.00, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and risk depleting the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 218.18, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for gradual adjustments as conditions change. A slight decrease from my previous theta will also help mitigate competition among wolves as our numbers grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.31, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to hunt sheep while also considering the need for sustainability and the potential for wolf population growth. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while still competing effectively with other wolves. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between both populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A moderate theta allows for a slight increase in hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
