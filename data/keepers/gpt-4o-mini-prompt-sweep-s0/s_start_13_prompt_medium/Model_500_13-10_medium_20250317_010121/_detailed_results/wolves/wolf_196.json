            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a lower hunting intensity is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. Given the current wolf population is relatively high, maintaining a theta of 0.30 will help balance competition among wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring both populations can stabilize and thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to sustain the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.19. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.43, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.40, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves.

This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and preventing over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.77, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors to avoid sudden changes and ensures long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.06, which is only 2.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting without risking the depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting.

            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 11.74, which is only 4.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.68, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly.
