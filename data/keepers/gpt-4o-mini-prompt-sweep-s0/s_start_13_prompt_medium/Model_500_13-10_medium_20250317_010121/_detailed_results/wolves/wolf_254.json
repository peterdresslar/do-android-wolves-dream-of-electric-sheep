        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This approach supports sustainable coexistence, as it allows for some reproduction among wolves without depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach is necessary to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for wolf reproduction. This theta value allows for a balanced strategy that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is potential for recovery. With a wolf population of 141, it is wise to focus more on competition among wolves rather than intense hunting, allowing sheep to stabilize and grow. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a balance while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are in a vulnerable state, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can still maintain some hunting pressure while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance."
