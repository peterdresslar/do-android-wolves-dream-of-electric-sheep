            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while allowing sheep to recover slightly. It also considers the recent growth in both populations, ensuring we adapt gradually to the changing conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing competition among wolves, which will help balance the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate needs of the wolves and the long-term health of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. This will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep while still allowing for some competition among wolves, which is necessary to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment in hunting intensity as the sheep population stabilizes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help create a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still acknowledging the need for some hunting to support our wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.07, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments and maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.05, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.12, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and ensure both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.32, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I will gradually increase my hunting intensity while still prioritizing competition with other wolves. This small adjustment allows for a cautious approach to hunting, giving sheep a chance to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.61, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and allow sheep to rebound, while also managing competition among wolves."
