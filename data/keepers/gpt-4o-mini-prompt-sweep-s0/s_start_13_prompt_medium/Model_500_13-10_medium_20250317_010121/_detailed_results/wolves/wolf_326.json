            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a level of hunting to support the wolf population, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep further. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while giving sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.40 will help balance the competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.31, which is just 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help to balance the competition among wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is extremely low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting but prioritizes the sustainability of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.07, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow for recovery. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack without depleting the sheep population further. This adjustment aligns with the need to balance our numbers while being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.93, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also addressing the competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem in the long run. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and adapting to changing conditions."
