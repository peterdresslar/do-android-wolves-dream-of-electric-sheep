        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction without risking a significant depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This adjustment reflects a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sustainability of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my theta to 0.55, I can intensify my hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep population to recover. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and my previous theta of 0.300 reflects a cautious approach. Maintaining this level allows the sheep to recover while minimizing competition among wolves, ensuring our long-term survival."
