            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 69.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a more intense hunting strategy without risking immediate depletion. However, I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also growing, so a slight reduction from my previous theta will help maintain balance and avoid overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and maintaining the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 141, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain a healthy wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.06. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is crucial for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for caution in hunting. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.300 to 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and helps maintain a sustainable balance."
