            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By setting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach will help maintain a balance as the sheep population grows, while also considering the current wolf population and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep population too quickly. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.35 aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need to compete with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This lower theta will help balance the populations over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the importance of allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still considering the need for hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. With a wolf population of 56, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is also quite low, suggesting that competition among wolves is high. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a modest hunting intensity that can help sustain my pack while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help maintain the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 3.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a modest hunting intensity while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.07, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep"
