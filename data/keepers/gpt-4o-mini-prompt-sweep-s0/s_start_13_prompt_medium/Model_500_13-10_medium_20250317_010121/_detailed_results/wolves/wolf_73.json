            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A slight increase to 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of sustainable coexistence and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.22. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still ensuring the wolf population can sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment in hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.07, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.05, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring we do not deplete the sheep further while still addressing our needs."
