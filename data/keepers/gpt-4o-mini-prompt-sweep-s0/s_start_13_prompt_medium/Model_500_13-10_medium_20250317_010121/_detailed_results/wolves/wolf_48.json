            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value promotes sustainable coexistence while still enabling our pack to thrive. It reflects a balanced approach, considering both the current sheep population and the need to maintain our wolf numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population's health without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, and a moderate hunting intensity will allow for coexistence while still supporting wolf reproduction. This approach balances the needs of both populations and avoids over-depleting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta value of 0.40 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep population while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting sustainability without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 72.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure that both wolves and sheep can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still addressing the needs of my pack."
