            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 77.04, which is only 30.8% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being cautious about the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of not depleting the sheep population too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing the wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure on the sheep, giving them a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance while preventing overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for sheep recovery while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to adapt to the current conditions without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.17. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in theta will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.56, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 34, it is crucial to focus on competition among wolves rather than hunting sheep aggressively. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.43, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances the need for wolf reproduction with the necessity of not depleting the sheep further."
