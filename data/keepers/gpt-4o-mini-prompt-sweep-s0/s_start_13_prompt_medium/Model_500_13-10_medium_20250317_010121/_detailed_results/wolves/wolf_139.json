            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.55, it is wise to focus on reducing hunting intensity slightly to allow the sheep to recover while still competing with other wolves. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, a moderate increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure my pack thrives, I must prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to maintain a sustainable ecosystem. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to rebound, preventing a crash in their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on maintaining a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, allowing for a gradual recovery of the sheep population while also supporting the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help the sheep population gradually increase, which is essential for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By reducing my hunting intensity further, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
