            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, allowing for gradual growth in both while avoiding depletion of the sheep. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. Gradual changes are key to ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value will help balance hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some reproduction among wolves while still giving sheep a chance to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a rapid decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to prevent overpopulation of wolves. This balance will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, maintaining a balance that supports both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and avoid depleting their numbers further, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help ensure a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to thrive, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes, ensuring the long-term survival of both species."
