            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the need for balance as both populations are relatively close. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the sheep population at a healthy level while allowing for growth in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to maintain hunting to support wolf reproduction, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A moderate increase in theta allows for some hunting while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to avoid depleting the sheep further. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta value of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the balance and sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and avoiding sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for food with the sustainability of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This balanced approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize without competing too aggressively with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still prioritizing the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment in response to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.07, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.05, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that considers both the immediate need for food and the long-term sustainability of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.12, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.32, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for hunting with the necessity of allowing the sheep population to grow."
