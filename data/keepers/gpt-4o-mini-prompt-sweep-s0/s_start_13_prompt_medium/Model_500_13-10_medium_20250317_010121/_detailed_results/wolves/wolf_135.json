            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is important to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 73, it's important to maintain a balance to avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.65 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 93, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival and sustainable cycles.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and my previous theta was on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a moderate hunting intensity that can help sustain the wolf population while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in sheep numbers.",
