            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. A theta of 0.7 strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive and allowing the sheep to recover, while also being mindful of the need to avoid sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This value will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack remains healthy. It reflects a cautious increase in hunting intensity, considering the sheep population is still below maximum capacity, and allows for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 63.00, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance our immediate hunting needs with the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need for a balanced approach to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves, a moderate theta value of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity, it could lead to their depletion and ultimately harm the wolf population as well. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
