            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, my previous theta was very low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive. A theta of 0.25 allows for a cautious approach, balancing the need to compete with other wolves while still enabling the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 63, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A moderate increase to 0.35 allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is key to ensuring long-term balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting to help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.400 allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that I do not over-deplete the sheep while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population, I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intense hunting. This moderate approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has the opportunity to grow, leading to a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a gradual adjustment in response to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable balance, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help stabilize both populations in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.22. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations."
