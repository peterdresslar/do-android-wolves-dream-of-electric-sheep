            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. By setting theta at 0.5, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support our wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence and avoids over-depleting the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports wolf reproduction while still considering the need for sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase helps maintain balance as both populations are currently stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my theta to 0.55, I can intensify my hunting slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing for the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive together. This adjustment also accounts for the growing wolf population, which suggests a need to be cautious in hunting intensity to avoid overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it is crucial to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help me focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
