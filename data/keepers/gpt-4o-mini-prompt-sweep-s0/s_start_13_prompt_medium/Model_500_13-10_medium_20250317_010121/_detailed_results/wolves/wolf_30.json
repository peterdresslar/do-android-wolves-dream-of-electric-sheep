            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious and avoid overexploitation, as the wolf population is also growing. A moderate increase to 0.45 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.3% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep population can recover and thrive. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 63, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to prevent a crash in the sheep population. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive together.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of my ancestors, promoting coexistence without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure my pack thrives, I need to prioritize the recovery of the sheep population to maintain a sustainable balance. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also giving sheep a chance to rebound, preventing future crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery in the sheep population. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still focus on hunting while allowing the sheep to gradually recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a balance and responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also reflects the need to adapt to the growing wolf population by not overexploiting the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring the sheep population has a chance to grow, promoting long-term sustainability for both species."
