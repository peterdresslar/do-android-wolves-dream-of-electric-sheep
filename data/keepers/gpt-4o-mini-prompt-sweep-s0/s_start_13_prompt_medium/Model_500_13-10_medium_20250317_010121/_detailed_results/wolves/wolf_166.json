            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a balanced approach. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio at 1.52, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate approach helps maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support a higher hunting intensity without risking their depletion. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to focus on hunting to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that can help sustain both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent over-exploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and a slight increase in hunting intensity is warranted to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep further. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still being mindful of the need to avoid overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem while preventing overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.56, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow for sheep recovery while also considering the growing wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species."
