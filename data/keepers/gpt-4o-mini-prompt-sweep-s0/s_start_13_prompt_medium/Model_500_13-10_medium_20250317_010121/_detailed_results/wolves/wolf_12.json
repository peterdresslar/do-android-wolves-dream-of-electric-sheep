            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is relatively low. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for sustainable coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This approach balances the immediate need for food with the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. With the sheep-to-wolf ratio being relatively high, I can maintain a sustainable coexistence while ensuring the wolf population remains stable. This moderate adjustment allows for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainability while still allowing for some hunting to support our pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual increase is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 63, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to maintain balance. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more moderate approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can still recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 will help maintain a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations."
