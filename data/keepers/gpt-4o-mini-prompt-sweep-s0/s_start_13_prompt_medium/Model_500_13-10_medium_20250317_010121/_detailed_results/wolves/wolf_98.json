This will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining balance and responding to the current ecosystem state.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while still giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach balances our needs with the sustainability of the ecosystem, avoiding overhunting and ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for adaptation to the growing wolf population and ensures sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This value reflects a cautious approach, enabling us to maintain our wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover and thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 73, it's important to maintain a balance to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for coexistence while still enabling some reproduction among wolves. This adjustment reflects a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow for their population to stabilize. Additionally, with the wolf population at 104, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help prevent overhunting and promote a sustainable balance in the ecosystem."
