            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This will help maintain the sheep population while ensuring the wolf pack can thrive. A slight reduction from my previous theta will help prevent over-depletion of sheep and promote a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 63, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and thrive. It reflects a balanced approach to coexistence, responding to the current state of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I also need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary. By focusing on competition with other wolves, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in our ecosystem. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. By increasing theta from 0.35 to 0.40, I can still maintain a focus on hunting while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance between both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need to allow the sheep to recover, so I will focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.40 will help maintain a balance while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a more sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting sustainability while still addressing the needs of my pack."
