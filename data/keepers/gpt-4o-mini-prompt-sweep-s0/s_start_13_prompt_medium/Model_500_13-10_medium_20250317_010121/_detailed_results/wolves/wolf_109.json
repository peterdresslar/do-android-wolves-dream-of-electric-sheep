            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a relatively low wolf population and a high sheep-to-wolf ratio, it is prudent to focus on competition among wolves to ensure our numbers remain stable. This moderate theta allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term balance of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A moderate approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 154.24, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population at 38.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.55, it is important to maintain a balanced approach to avoid over-depleting the sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a more cautious strategy, promoting sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to recover while also managing competition with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 104, it's essential to focus on competition among wolves to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must do so cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a balanced approach that encourages coexistence while still addressing the immediate needs of my pack."
