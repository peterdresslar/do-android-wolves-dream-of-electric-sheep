This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring wolf reproduction and allowing the sheep population to recover, considering the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the overall ecosystem health.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value supports a balanced approach, enabling both wolf and sheep populations to thrive while avoiding competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. Given that the sheep-to-wolf ratio is relatively high, a gradual increase in hunting will ensure a balance between our needs and the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem without risking over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a balance that prevents over-depletion of the sheep population. It reflects a moderate approach that considers both the current state and the trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow for recovery. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while still competing with other wolves. This moderate approach helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to over-deplete the sheep.",
