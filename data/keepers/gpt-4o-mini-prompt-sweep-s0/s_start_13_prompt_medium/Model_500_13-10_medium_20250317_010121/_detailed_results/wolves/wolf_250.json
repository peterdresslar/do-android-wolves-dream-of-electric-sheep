            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balanced approach, ensuring that both sheep and wolf populations can thrive together while also considering the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure long-term survival. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 141, I need to be cautious to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This suggests that while I need to be cautious about hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover, I also need to ensure that the wolf population remains healthy. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, which indicates a need for caution in hunting. Maintaining a lower theta allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a bit more hunting to support wolf reproduction while still being cautious to avoid depleting the sheep further. This gradual adjustment aligns with the need for sustainable coexistence."
