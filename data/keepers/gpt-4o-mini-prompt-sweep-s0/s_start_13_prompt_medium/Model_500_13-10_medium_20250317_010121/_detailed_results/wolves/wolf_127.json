            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, my previous theta was quite low, and I need to gradually increase my hunting intensity to ensure the wolf population can thrive without depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.3 allows for a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a moderate level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A slight decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance while allowing the sheep to recover and ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack can thrive, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the declining sheep numbers."
