            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently healthy at 216.30, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is relatively low, and I want to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly. A theta of 0.70 strikes a balance between ensuring my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and sustain their numbers over time. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 69.2% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly while still supporting wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (26.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are competing for resources. A moderate theta allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to recover. This approach balances our immediate needs with the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term survival of both species, ensuring that the wolf population does not deplete the sheep too quickly."
