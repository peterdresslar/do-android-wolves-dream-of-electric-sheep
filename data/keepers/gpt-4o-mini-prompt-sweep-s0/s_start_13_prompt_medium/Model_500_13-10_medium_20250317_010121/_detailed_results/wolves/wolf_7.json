A moderate hunting intensity will help maintain a balance, preventing over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction within the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are more sheep available per wolf. This suggests that a slight reduction in hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to maintain its health. A moderate approach will help ensure long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.32, which is only 5.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to support our wolf population without depleting the sheep further, promoting a sustainable balance.",
