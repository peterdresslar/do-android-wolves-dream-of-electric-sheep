            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for increased hunting intensity without risking depletion. However, I must remain cautious as the wolf population is also growing, so a moderate increase will help maintain balance and ensure sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment allows us to maintain balance without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value strikes a balance between ensuring the wolf population remains healthy and allowing the sheep to recover, aligning with the wisdom of gradual adjustments in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This approach helps maintain balance in the ecosystem while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is room for the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with my goal of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to support wolf reproduction while allowing the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.400 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and promote a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, promoting a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 5.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
