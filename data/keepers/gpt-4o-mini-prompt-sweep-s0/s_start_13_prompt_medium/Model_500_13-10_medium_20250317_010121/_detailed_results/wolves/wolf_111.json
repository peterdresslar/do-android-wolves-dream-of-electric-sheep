            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 6.23, it is essential to maintain a balance to prevent over-depletion of the sheep population. A moderate theta of 0.60 allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance helps prevent over-depletion of the sheep while still allowing for sustainable coexistence as the wolf population grows.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable coexistence while still enabling us to thrive.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta of 0.55 was more aggressive, a slight reduction to 0.45 allows for a balanced approach that supports both sheep recovery and wolf competition. This adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain intense hunting. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition with other wolves. This balance is crucial for the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure long-term sustainability, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will help stabilize both populations and prevent a crash."
