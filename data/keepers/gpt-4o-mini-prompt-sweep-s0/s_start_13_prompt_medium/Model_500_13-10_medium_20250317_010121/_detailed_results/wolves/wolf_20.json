            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolves and sheep while ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term. A slight decrease from my previous theta will allow for some recovery of the sheep as the wolf population is relatively stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion. This adjustment supports my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual increase in theta reflects the need to balance our hunting with the competition among wolves, promoting coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance helps maintain both populations sustainably without risking depletion.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while allowing for some growth in the wolf population. This adjustment is gradual, aligning with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that can support both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery. This balance will help maintain the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for recovery. With a wolf population of 88, it is wise to focus more on competition with other wolves to ensure our numbers remain stable while allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help balance our needs without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while allowing the sheep to gradually increase.
