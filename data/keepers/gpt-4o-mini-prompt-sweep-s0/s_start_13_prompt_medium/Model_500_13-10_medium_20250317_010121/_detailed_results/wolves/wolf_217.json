            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between the wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Additionally, with the current wolf population, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is relatively high at 206.20, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value supports sustainable coexistence while also considering the growing wolf population, which requires a careful balance to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A moderate theta value balances our need for food with the necessity of maintaining a stable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that aggressive hunting could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and promotes long-term sustainability for both populations."
