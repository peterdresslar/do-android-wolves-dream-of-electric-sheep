            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A balanced approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to adapt to the current dynamics of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment will support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help maintain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not become overly depleted. A theta of 0.55 reflects a balanced approach, promoting coexistence and sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a wolf population of 141, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is low, suggesting that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while still keeping an eye on the dynamics of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is relatively high. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments to maintain balance in the ecosystem."
