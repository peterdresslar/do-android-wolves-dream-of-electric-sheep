            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow for sustainable coexistence. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach to ensure both populations can thrive without depleting resources too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 141.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that supports both populations in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a healthy balance in the wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments to ensure long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.31, which is just 2.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and prevent overexploitation of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that aggressive hunting could lead to a collapse of the sheep population, which would ultimately harm our long-term survival. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population a chance to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 3.04, which is just 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and promote a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash."
