            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 218.18, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate theta value will help maintain the sheep population while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. It is important to avoid sudden changes and to adapt gradually as conditions evolve.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring sustainability while also allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction. Gradually adjusting down from my previous theta of 0.50 reflects a cautious approach to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.31, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete their numbers. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term survival of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring both populations can thrive without leading to a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta was 0.450, I want to slightly reduce my hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover and increase their numbers. This will help maintain a sustainable balance between our populations and ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need for wolves to compete with each other while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations."
