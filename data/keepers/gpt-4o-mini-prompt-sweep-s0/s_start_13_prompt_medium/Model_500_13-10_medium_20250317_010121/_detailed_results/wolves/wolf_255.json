            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 69.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, my previous theta was quite low, and while I want to allow the sheep to recover, I also need to ensure the wolf population remains stable. A gradual increase to 0.25 allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase in theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 65.01, which is only 26.0% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and if I increase my hunting intensity, it could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.06. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep population to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. However, I also recognize the need for wolves to maintain a healthy population, so a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the competition among wolves while still being cautious about overhunting."
