            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with a wolf population of 63, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to maintain balance. A moderate increase to 0.75 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. A gradual adjustment is key to avoiding drastic fluctuations in either population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent overexploitation of the sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting a lower theta, I can focus more on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to increase their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 80, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the balance needed for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.22, focusing on competition with other wolves is essential to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in both populations.",
