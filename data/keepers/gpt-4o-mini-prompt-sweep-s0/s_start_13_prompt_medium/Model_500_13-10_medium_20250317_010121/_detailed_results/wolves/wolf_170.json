            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate increase in hunting intensity allows for sustainable coexistence while ensuring that both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.60 will enable me to hunt enough to support my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that while hunting intensity can be increased, it should be done cautiously to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still focusing on the competition among wolves, ensuring a balance that supports both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also managing our wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity, allowing for a more sustainable coexistence and preventing a crash in the sheep population. Gradually adjusting to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to ensure both species can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a lower hunting intensity will allow them to rebuild their numbers. Additionally, with a wolf population of 88, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensively. This will help balance the populations and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 7.25, which is just 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover, so a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 will help balance my focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting. This gradual adjustment is essential for maintaining a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.7% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 6.43, which is only 2.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep."
