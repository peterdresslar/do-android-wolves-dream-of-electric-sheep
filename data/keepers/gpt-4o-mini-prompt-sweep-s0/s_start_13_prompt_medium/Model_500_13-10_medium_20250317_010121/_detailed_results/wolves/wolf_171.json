            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate hunting approach. This will help maintain the balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overhunting. Gradually increasing my hunting intensity will support wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack without depleting the sheep further, promoting a healthier balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for a cautious approach to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support the wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced strategy that promotes coexistence without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance while avoiding overhunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 5.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow for recovery. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, increasing my hunting intensity too quickly could lead to a further decline in sheep numbers, jeopardizing long-term sustainability. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the balance between both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.32, which is only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help me maintain a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. By maintaining a lower theta, I can help stabilize the sheep population while also managing competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting intensity will help create a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep to replenish while also managing competition with other wolves. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment will help maintain a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 2.6% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their depletion. By setting theta at 0.30, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species."
