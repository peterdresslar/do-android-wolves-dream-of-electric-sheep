            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.304 will enable me to maintain some hunting intensity while still focusing on competition with other wolves, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more conservative approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is potential for recovery if I reduce my hunting intensity slightly. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep to recover while still allowing for some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure sustainable coexistence, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep.
