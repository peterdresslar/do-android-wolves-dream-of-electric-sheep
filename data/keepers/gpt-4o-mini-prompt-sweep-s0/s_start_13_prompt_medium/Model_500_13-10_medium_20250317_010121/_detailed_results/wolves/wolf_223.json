            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a sustainable balance. This adjustment will help support the wolf population without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 206.20, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment reflects the need to support wolf reproduction without depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This moderate adjustment will help maintain a balance between our population and the sheep, ensuring sustainable coexistence while also allowing for some growth in our numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, I need to maintain a cautious approach to avoid overhunting. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a balanced strategy that supports both sheep recovery and wolf population stability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and while I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By lowering my hunting intensity slightly, I can allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a focus on competition with other wolves. This balanced approach will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help balance the ecosystem and prevent overexploitation of the sheep."
