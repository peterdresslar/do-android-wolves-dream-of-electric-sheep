            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively low at 30.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, which allows for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help balance the needs of the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover gradually.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.650 allowed for some hunting, it is crucial to focus on a more balanced approach to ensure the sheep can recover. A theta of 0.45 allows for moderate hunting while also considering the need to compete with other wolves, promoting a sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting sheep. This will allow the sheep population to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensively hunting. This lower theta will help balance the populations and promote long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 4.1% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure a sustainable ecosystem, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will help maintain the balance and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A small increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being cautious not to deplete the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves at this lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This gradual adjustment will help maintain the balance between both populations without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 6.77, which is only 2.7% of its maximum capacity. To allow the sheep to recover and ensure their long-term survival, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves rather than hunting intensely. This will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and a more cautious approach is needed to allow for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta, I can still support wolf reproduction while being mindful of the sheep"
