            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for some hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population being relatively low, I want to avoid overhunting and maintain a balance that supports both species. A slight decrease from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach, ensuring sustainability while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 52.7% of its maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This slight increase from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the growing sheep population while being cautious not to over-deplete their numbers. It allows for sustainable coexistence and supports the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase aligns with the current trends and avoids sudden changes that could destabilize the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This value reflects a balance between hunting and competing with other wolves, ensuring the sustainability of both populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 56.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 5.68, it is wise to maintain a slightly lower hunting intensity to allow for sustainable coexistence and to avoid depleting the sheep population too quickly. This adjustment will help balance the needs of both wolves and sheep while considering the current trends in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring our long-term survival while also allowing for some growth in our pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still ensuring that the sheep population can recover and maintain balance. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, the wolf population is also significant, so I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate theta allows for some hunting while also considering the need for balance and the potential growth of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can continue to thrive. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate level of hunting to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and hunting sheep, promoting sustainability in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 14.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can help ensure a sustainable balance while also considering the growing wolf population. This gradual adjustment will help maintain the delicate ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to allow for some recovery of the sheep while still ensuring the wolf population remains healthy. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 allows for a more balanced approach, promoting coexistence without risking a crash in the sheep population."
