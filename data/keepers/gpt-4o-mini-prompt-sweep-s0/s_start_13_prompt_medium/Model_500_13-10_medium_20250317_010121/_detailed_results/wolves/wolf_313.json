            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase from my previous theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still considering the long-term health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.18. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. By setting theta at 0.40, I can focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some hunting, ensuring a balance that promotes sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous theta was already on the lower end. A slight increase to 0.35 allows for a modest increase in hunting intensity, which can help sustain my pack while still giving the sheep a chance to recover. This adjustment is gradual and considers both the current low sheep population and the need to maintain a healthy wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.04. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of adapting to changing conditions and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give sheep a chance to rebound, while still allowing for some competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining some hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual increase in theta will help balance the needs of both populations without causing immediate depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.9% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe scarcity of prey. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual adjustment to a lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low, and hunting them aggressively would lead to their depletion. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still focusing on competition with other wolves, which is necessary to maintain our population. This approach supports the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.94, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.30 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves while giving sheep a chance to rebound."
