            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This balance will help sustain both the wolf and sheep populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high, and I want to maintain a balance that allows for sustainable coexistence. With the sheep population at 82.5% of maximum capacity, a moderate hunting intensity will help ensure that both sheep and wolves can thrive without depleting resources too quickly. This adjustment allows for gradual hunting while being mindful of the wolf population growth.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio, a gradual increase in hunting will help ensure that both populations can thrive without leading to depletion or overcompetition.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 110, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By adopting a lower hunting intensity, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both our pack and the sheep, while still being mindful of the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at only 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on reducing competition with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach that acknowledges the need for some hunting while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species."
