            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 21.4% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance between wolf reproduction and sheep recovery, allowing both populations to thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition, promoting sustainability without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations. It also reflects a cautious approach as the wolf population is relatively high at 87.00, necessitating a balance to avoid over-depletion of sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity will allow the sheep to recover while also addressing the competition among wolves. This approach supports long-term sustainability for both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to focus on hunting to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also be cautious not to deplete the sheep population further. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition among wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help maintain a balance and prevent overhunting, which could lead to a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.30 to 0.35, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.11, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the need for gradual adjustments.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that we are at risk of depleting their numbers further. By focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining our own sustainability. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of our ancestors and helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while also maintaining a healthy wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a bit more hunting to support reproduction, but not so much that it risks depleting the sheep further. This balanced approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.07, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing for some competition with other wolves as the population is relatively high.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 9.05, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a cautious approach to hunting, balancing the need for sustenance with the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.12, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also allowing the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.32, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a more balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting to support reproduction. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.61, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.00, which is only 4.0% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling the wolf population to sustain itself. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 to 0.35 reflects a cautious approach to balance hunting and competition with other wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.45, which is only 4.2% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low, and the wolf population is at a similar level. A slight increase in hunting intensity will help sustain our population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually.
