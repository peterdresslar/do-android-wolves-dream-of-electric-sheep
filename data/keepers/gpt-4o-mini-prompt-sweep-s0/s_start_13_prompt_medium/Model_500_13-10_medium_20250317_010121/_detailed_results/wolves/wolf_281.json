            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.11, I need to be cautious not to overhunt, as this could lead to a depletion of the sheep population. A moderate increase to 0.65 allows for continued reproduction among wolves while still maintaining a balance with the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 141.00, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, avoiding overexploitation.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also being mindful of the growing wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting to sustain our pack while prioritizing the long-term health of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite unfavorable for hunting. By focusing on competition with other wolves at this lower theta, I can allow the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.1% of its maximum capacity, indicating that we need to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta will enable me to maintain some hunting pressure while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. Focusing on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting will allow the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term survival for both species. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual approach will help maintain balance and prevent a crash in both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a severe scarcity of prey. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to recover while ensuring the long-term survival of both species.
