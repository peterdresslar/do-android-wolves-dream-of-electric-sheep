        "explanations": [
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. A moderate theta of 0.55 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain a healthy wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover and thrive. This gradual adjustment reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions without risking a depletion of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate approach allows for a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, ensuring both populations can thrive in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus more on competing with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. Maintaining a lower hunting intensity allows the sheep to recover while also preventing overcompetition among wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, a slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 is warranted to adapt to the current conditions and ensure that the wolf population can sustain itself without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low at 0.04. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population stabilize while allowing our wolf pack to adapt to the changing conditions. This gradual approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance."
