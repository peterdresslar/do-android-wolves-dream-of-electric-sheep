            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population dynamics.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain the wolf population while allowing the sheep to recover gradually. This adjustment aligns with the wisdom of making small changes in response to population trends.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the long-term sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to bounce back.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 5.31, which is only 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover, and a slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction among wolves while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance and avoids sudden population crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the sustainability of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a presence in the ecosystem.
