            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a gradual increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the need to maintain a balance, a lower theta will help focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for gradual hunting without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.25 allows for a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still being mindful of the sheep",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we should be cautious with our hunting intensity to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.35 to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, allowing for some hunting while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves, allowing the sheep population to gradually increase while ensuring the wolf population remains stable.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting for the wolves",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This lower theta will allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a stable wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to be cautious with our hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps avoid sudden impacts on the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while ensuring that the sheep population has the opportunity to grow, ultimately supporting the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual decrease in hunting will help ensure the long-term survival of both species while maintaining a healthy balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.30 strikes a balance between competing with other wolves and allowing the sheep population to stabilize, ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 9.25, which is only 3.7% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to hunt a bit more effectively while still prioritizing the sustainability of both populations. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.07, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover before increasing hunting intensity. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to rebound, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.05, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity to 0.35, I can still focus on competition with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.12, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can help the sheep population stabilize while also managing competition among wolves."
