            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate hunting approach that balances the needs of both wolves and sheep. This value supports sustainable coexistence while still enabling some hunting to maintain our population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 82.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term balance between wolves and sheep. This moderate adjustment helps maintain a sustainable coexistence as I respond to the current conditions without risking a sudden decline in sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balance. This adjustment supports the wolf population",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a healthy wolf population while allowing for the sheep to recover gradually. This approach aligns with the wisdom of making small adjustments based on current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 26.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting without depleting their numbers too quickly. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, ensuring that both the sheep and wolf populations can thrive together. This small adjustment from my previous theta reflects the need to adapt to the current conditions while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 10.6% of its maximum capacity, and the wolf population is relatively high. A lower theta allows for a focus on competition among wolves, which can help stabilize our numbers while giving the sheep a chance to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover while being mindful of the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance."
