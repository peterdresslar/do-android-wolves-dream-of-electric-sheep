            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. My previous theta was quite low, and while I want to continue focusing on competition with other wolves, I can afford to increase my hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction without over-depleting the sheep. This gradual adjustment will help maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations while avoiding overexploitation. A gradual increase from my previous theta will support wolf reproduction without risking a crash in the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking over-depletion of the sheep. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, promoting wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain the wolf population without depleting the sheep too quickly. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for more hunting while still prioritizing balance and the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize and grow, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase, ensuring a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.300 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to thrive, promoting a sustainable ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Maintaining a lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, focusing on sustainable coexistence while still allowing for some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.4% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to rebound, while also managing the competition among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. A slight increase from my previous theta will help maintain a balance without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 9.57, which is only 3.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover before increasing our hunting intensity. A theta of 0.30 allows for a slight focus on competition with other wolves while still enabling some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance."
