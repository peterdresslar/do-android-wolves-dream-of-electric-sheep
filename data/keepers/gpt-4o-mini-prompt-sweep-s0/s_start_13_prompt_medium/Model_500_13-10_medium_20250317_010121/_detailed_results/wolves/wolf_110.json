            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 64.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still a healthy number of sheep available. However, with the wolf population at 18, which is relatively low compared to the sheep, I need to focus on maintaining a balance. A theta of 0.30 allows for some hunting while also prioritizing competition among wolves, ensuring that we do not deplete the sheep population too quickly and can sustain both species in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while also ensuring that the sheep do not become over-depleted. A gradual adjustment towards a more balanced approach will support both species in the long term.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help support wolf reproduction while still maintaining a sustainable balance with the sheep population. Given the current sheep-to-wolf ratio and the trends in both populations, a gradual increase in theta will help avoid over-depletion of sheep and ensure long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.55, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid over-hunting to ensure our long-term survival. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, but I need to be cautious as the wolf population is also significant. A moderate hunting intensity will allow for some sheep population growth while ensuring that my pack remains healthy and competitive. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to sustain aggressive hunting. By adopting a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover, ensuring long-term balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that there is room for cautious hunting to help sustain my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep need time to recover. By setting theta at 0.35, I can focus more on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both species."
