            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 77.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting intensity without risking a rapid depletion of the sheep. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still considering the need for balance as the sheep numbers are healthy. A gradual decrease from my previous theta reflects a cautious approach to ensure long-term survival.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still healthy at 82.8% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep do not deplete too quickly. A gradual approach is essential to maintain balance and avoid sudden crashes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 86.5% of maximum capacity, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while ensuring that the sheep can recover if needed. A gradual adjustment is essential to maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively high at 87.3% of maximum capacity, allowing for a balanced approach to hunting. This moderate intensity will help sustain both the sheep and wolf populations while avoiding overexploitation of the sheep. It also allows for gradual adjustments as conditions change.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This balance will help maintain sustainable coexistence as both populations fluctuate.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity that supports wolf reproduction while ensuring the sheep can recover. This approach balances our needs with the ecosystem",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 49.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. By increasing my hunting intensity slightly, I can help ensure the wolf population remains healthy while still allowing the sheep to recover. This moderate adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (26.0% of maximum capacity), and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support aggressive hunting. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling the sheep population to recover while still allowing for some hunting to sustain the wolf population. This gradual adjustment helps maintain the delicate ecosystem without risking a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for a balanced approach, reducing hunting intensity slightly to support sheep recovery while still competing with other wolves."
