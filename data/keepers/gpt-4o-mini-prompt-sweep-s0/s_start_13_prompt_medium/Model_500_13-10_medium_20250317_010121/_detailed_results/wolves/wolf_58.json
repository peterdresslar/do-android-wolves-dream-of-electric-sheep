            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 40.9% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for growth. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.62, it is wise to focus on competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance. This gradual adjustment will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a sustainable level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still prioritizing the long-term survival of both species. This moderate adjustment will help maintain balance as the sheep population recovers, while also considering the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 53.43, which is only 21.4% of its maximum capacity. This allows for a slight increase in hunting intensity while still being cautious. A gradual increase to 0.40 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep population can recover over time.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 36.79, which is only 14.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By slightly reducing my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to stabilize while still competing with other wolves. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.42, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. Additionally, with a wolf population of 87, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 20.30, which is only 8.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight increase in hunting intensity. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for sustainable coexistence, balancing the need for wolf reproduction with the health of the sheep population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 16.49, which is only 6.6% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity and allow the sheep population to recover. This lower theta will help maintain a balance in the ecosystem and prevent over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 13.89, which is only 5.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the wolf population remains healthy, I must also allow the sheep to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will enable me to maintain a balanced approach, focusing on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to support reproduction without depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.14, which is only 4.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while giving the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, ensuring long-term sustainability for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is quite low at 10.91, which is only 4.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderate to allow for recovery of the sheep while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 4.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.24. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep population to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves at this lower theta, I can help ensure the long-term survival of both species while avoiding over-depletion of the sheep."
