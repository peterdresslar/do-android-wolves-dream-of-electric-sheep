            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain our wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly and to maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 54, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking immediate depletion. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure sustainable coexistence. A moderate increase in theta allows for a balanced approach that supports both wolf reproduction and sheep recovery.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and prevent over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some hunting to support wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. While I want to ensure the survival of my pack, I also recognize the need to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving sheep a chance to increase their numbers. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be moderated to allow the sheep to recover. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach, focusing more on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting to maintain our population. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 98, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight hunting intensity to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while being mindful of the declining sheep numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while managing competition with other wolves. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent overhunting."
