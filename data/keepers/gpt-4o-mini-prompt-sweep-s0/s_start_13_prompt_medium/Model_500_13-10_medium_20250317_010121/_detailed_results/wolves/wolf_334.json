            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a low level (26.0% of maximum capacity), allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity without risking immediate depletion. This adjustment will help maintain a balance as the sheep population can still recover while ensuring the wolf population remains healthy.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 26.58, which is only 10.6% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By adopting a moderate hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This approach aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and avoiding sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.85, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates a need for caution in hunting to allow the sheep to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 allows for some hunting while prioritizing the sustainability of both populations, as the wolf population is relatively high at 140. This approach helps maintain balance and avoids depleting the sheep further.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 3.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while competing with other wolves. This lower hunting intensity will help maintain a balance and prevent a crash in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 5.31, which is just 2.1% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. By focusing more on competition with other wolves, I can help stabilize the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to increase. A gradual adjustment is essential to avoid sudden impacts on both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. This indicates that we need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover rather than intensifying hunting. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from 0.20 to 0.25, I can still focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to stabilize. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance and ensures the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.0% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase in theta is necessary as the sheep population grows, but for now, a lower theta will help maintain balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates a significant competition for resources among wolves. A slight increase in hunting intensity will allow for some reproduction while still prioritizing the recovery of the sheep population. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating a need for recovery. By focusing more on competition with other wolves rather than intense hunting, I can help the sheep population rebound while ensuring the long-term survival of both species. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a dynamic balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 1.98, which is just 0.8% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on reducing hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash in the sheep population, which is essential for the future of my pack.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is very low. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, I need to focus on reducing competition with other wolves and allow the sheep population to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and prevent a crash.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low, and my previous focus on hunting has led to a significant depletion of their numbers. By slightly increasing my theta, I can still hunt, but I will prioritize competition with other wolves to allow the sheep population to recover. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of maintaining a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.93, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are struggling, and increasing hunting intensity could lead to their further decline. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 1.96, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help stabilize the ecosystem and ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, while also addressing the current imbalance in the sheep-to-wolf ratio.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is critically low at only 0.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that aggressive hunting could lead to their extinction. By maintaining a lower theta, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to recover. This approach aligns with the wisdom of gradual adjustments and aims for long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 2.09, which is only 0.8% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that hunting intensity should remain low to allow the sheep to recover. However, with a wolf population of 17, there is a need to slightly increase hunting intensity to ensure the wolves can sustain themselves without depleting the sheep too quickly. A gradual increase to 0.35 allows for a balanced approach while still being cautious."
