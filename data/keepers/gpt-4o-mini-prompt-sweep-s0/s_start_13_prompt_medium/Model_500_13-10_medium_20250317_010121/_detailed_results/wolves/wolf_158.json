            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, I need to be cautious not to overhunt and deplete the sheep population too quickly. A moderate increase in hunting intensity will help maintain a balance while allowing for wolf reproduction.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population being relatively high, a moderate approach will help maintain balance and avoid over-depletion of sheep while still allowing for some reproduction among wolves.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that a more moderate hunting intensity is appropriate. This allows for some hunting to support wolf reproduction while also giving the sheep a chance to recover. A gradual adjustment helps maintain balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. While my previous theta of 0.55 allowed for some hunting, it is important to reduce hunting intensity to allow the sheep population to recover. A theta of 0.45 strikes a balance between hunting and competition with other wolves, promoting sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low at 0.22. This indicates that while there is some opportunity for hunting, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep population to recover. A moderate theta of 0.35 will help maintain a balance between competing with other wolves and ensuring the sheep can rebound, promoting long-term sustainability.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that the sheep are vulnerable and need time to recover. By maintaining a lower hunting intensity, I can focus on competing with other wolves while allowing the sheep population to gradually increase. This approach aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and ensuring long-term survival for both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 12.74, which is only 5.1% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is necessary to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while still allowing for some hunting, promoting a sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently very low at 4.1% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low as well. To ensure the long-term survival of both species, it",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 8.91, which is only 3.6% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure the survival of my pack, I must also allow the sheep population to recover. A slight increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain a balance between hunting and allowing sheep to regenerate, while still being cautious about the growing wolf population.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.88, which is only 3.2% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while also considering the growing wolf population. A lower theta will help reduce hunting pressure and promote a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 7.25, which is only 2.9% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that we need to allow the sheep to recover while still maintaining a slight focus on hunting to support our wolf population. A moderate increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help balance the needs of both species without risking a crash in the sheep population."
