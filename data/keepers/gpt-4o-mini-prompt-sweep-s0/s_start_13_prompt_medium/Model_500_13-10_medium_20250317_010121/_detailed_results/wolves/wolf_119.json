            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover. A gradual approach is essential to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.55, it is important to maintain a balance to avoid over-depleting the sheep. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for continued hunting while also considering the need for the sheep to recover and the wolf population to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with a relatively high wolf population and a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 1.52, I need to be cautious not to overhunt. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, enabling us to maintain both populations while adapting to the current conditions.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. While my previous theta of 0.450 was focused on moderate hunting, I believe a slight reduction to 0.40 will allow for a more balanced approach, giving sheep a chance to recover while still maintaining a healthy wolf population. This small adjustment aligns with the wisdom of gradual changes and helps ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that a more cautious approach is needed to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my hunting intensity from the previous theta of 0.40 to 0.35, I can still maintain a focus on competition with other wolves while allowing for some sustainable hunting. This balance will help ensure the long-term survival of both species.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is an opportunity to increase hunting intensity slightly to support wolf reproduction while still allowing the sheep population to recover. A gradual increase to 0.40 reflects a balanced approach, acknowledging the need for sustainable coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover while still maintaining a moderate hunting intensity. A theta of 0.35 reflects a cautious approach that balances competition with other wolves and the need for sustainable hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. With the wolf population at 88.00, the sheep-to-wolf ratio is quite low, indicating that hunting intensity should be reduced to allow the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help ensure the long-term survival of both species by preventing overhunting and promoting a sustainable balance."
