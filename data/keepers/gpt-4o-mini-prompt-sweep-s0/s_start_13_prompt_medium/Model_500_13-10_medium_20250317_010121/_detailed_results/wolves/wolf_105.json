            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing the sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to maintain balance and avoid depleting the sheep too quickly.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a slight increase in hunting intensity without risking depletion. This adjustment reflects a balance between ensuring the wolf population can thrive while still allowing sheep to recover and maintain their numbers.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is still relatively healthy at 161.88, allowing for a moderate hunting intensity. This will help maintain a balance between wolf and sheep populations, ensuring that both can thrive without depleting resources. A slight reduction from my previous theta allows for a cautious approach as the wolf population is also growing.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 61.7% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for sustainable hunting. However, with a wolf population of 38, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting, which could lead to a decline in sheep numbers and ultimately harm both populations. A slight increase from my previous theta allows for some hunting while still prioritizing balance and coexistence.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is still room for growth. A moderate theta of 0.40 allows for a balanced approach, enabling me to maintain hunting pressure while also considering the need for sheep recovery. This adjustment helps ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because it represents a slight increase in hunting intensity while still maintaining a balanced approach. The sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, allowing for some increased hunting without risking depletion. This adjustment will help sustain our wolf population while ensuring the sheep can recover.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for gradual hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population also being relatively high, a slight reduction in hunting intensity will help maintain balance and allow both populations to stabilize.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 48.72, which is only 19.5% of its maximum capacity. While I need to ensure my pack",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. Given the high wolf population of 104, it is wise to focus on competition among wolves rather than intensifying hunting. This will allow the sheep to recover while maintaining a sustainable balance in the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This suggests that hunting intensity should remain moderate to allow the sheep to recover while still enabling some hunting to support the wolf population. A gradual increase from my previous theta of 0.30 will help maintain balance without depleting the sheep further."
