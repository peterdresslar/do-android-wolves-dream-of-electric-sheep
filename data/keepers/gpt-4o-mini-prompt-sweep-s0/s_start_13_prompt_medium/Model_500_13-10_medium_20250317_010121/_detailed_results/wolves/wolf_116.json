            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This will help sustain the wolf population while still allowing sheep to recover. A gradual adjustment is necessary to avoid depleting the sheep too quickly, ensuring a balanced ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at a healthy level, allowing for a moderate increase in hunting intensity. This adjustment will help sustain the wolf population while still enabling the sheep to recover and thrive. A gradual increase is essential to avoid over-depletion of the sheep.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 55.0% of its maximum capacity, indicating a healthy number of sheep available for hunting. However, with a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 2.55, I need to be cautious about overhunting to ensure the long-term survival of both species. A moderate theta of 0.45 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the growth of the wolf population and the need to avoid sudden changes.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 44.5% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for increased hunting without risking depletion. However, with the wolf population at 73, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting. A moderate increase to 0.55 allows for sustainable hunting while still considering the long-term health of both populations.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently at 30.8% of its maximum capacity, indicating that there is room for sustainable hunting. However, with the wolf population at 93, I need to be cautious and avoid overhunting to ensure both populations can thrive. A moderate theta allows for a balanced approach, promoting coexistence while still enabling some hunting.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 19.5% of its maximum capacity, and the sheep-to-wolf ratio indicates that there are not enough sheep to support intense hunting. By lowering my hunting intensity, I can allow the sheep population to recover while also managing competition with other wolves, ensuring a more sustainable balance.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 31.65, which is only 12.7% of its maximum capacity. With a sheep-to-wolf ratio of 0.30, it is crucial to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. By maintaining a lower theta, I can prioritize competition with other wolves and ensure that the sheep population has the opportunity to grow, which will ultimately benefit the wolf population in the long run.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 21.79, which is only 8.7% of its maximum capacity. This indicates that there is a need for cautious hunting to allow the sheep to recover. By slightly increasing my theta from 0.30 to 0.35, I can maintain a balance that supports the wolf population while giving the sheep a chance to grow. This gradual adjustment aligns with the wisdom of avoiding sudden changes and responding to the current state of the ecosystem.",
            "I chose this theta because the sheep population is currently low at 15.95, which is only 6.4% of its maximum capacity. To ensure the long-term survival of both wolves and sheep, I need to focus on allowing the sheep to recover. A lower theta will help reduce hunting intensity and give the sheep a chance to increase their numbers, while also managing competition among wolves."
