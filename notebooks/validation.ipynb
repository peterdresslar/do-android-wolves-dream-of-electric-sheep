    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation of Lotka-Volterra employs wolves (predators) and sheep (prey) as model organisms. Additionally, our system employs an additional parameter in complex with the intrinsic $\\beta$ parameter of \"base\" LV called $\\theta$. The complex is added to both equations of the system in order to add and balance a \"predation intensity\" term which is somewhat like the one proposed by Holling (1973). However, for the purposes of our validation, the $\\theta\\ parameter will always be set to one, thus \"washing out\" of our model. So:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w$ is number of wolves and $s$ number of sheep. Elsewhere in this notebook we will omit the $\\theta$ variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our \"partially discretized\" model implementation of the LV system, the continuous curve of the predator population, wolves, is replaced by the use of a model implementation in which wolf \"agents\" are individualized and have discrete, integer population counts at every step. The discrete population notably cannot rebound from a sub-1 value.  The prey population, the sheep, are left to operate as a single population group, with non-discrete (implemented as a floating point number, so our discretion is limited!) populations that can exist at sub-1 counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of discretized systems is widely discussed and debated in simulation and agent-based modeling literature. [CITATIONS]\n",

    "One theoretical difference between our discretized model and the continous functions they are intended to instantiate is the modeling application of finite time. Effectively, in order for our model to be a model, our model agents need discrete time points at which they can observe and interact with the environment. Meanwhile, since we are attempting to orchestrate domain processes that operate according to the continous system, our discrete time points also need enough organization so that we can reassemble their history in a way that they can be compared against a similar amount of continuous time. We accomplish this, in the case of this and many other models, using \"steps,\" which are points in time spaced equally using a variable we call `dt`. This variable name is of course not an accident; our `dt` is designed to match up with the same \"delta time (dt)\" variable governing the continuous system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of our use of discrete time points, it is expected that our simulation will operate in a more \"coarse\" fashion than the underlying continuous system. However, another concept to note here is that we will use a \"continuous equation solver\" (`scipy-integrate.solve-ivp`)implemented for Python to represent the output of the continuous equations. That program, being a computer program running in our universe, also uses discrete steps, although by default they are far finer than the ones that we use in our model. Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged that we are working with discrete computing with both systems, and that we might expect for the output solutions to conform more closely as the gap between time-step scales of the two systems is reduced (for instance, as `dt` is set smaller in our discretized version.)"
