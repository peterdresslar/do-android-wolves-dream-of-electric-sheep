    "The purpose of this notebook to validate the outputs generated by our discretized Lotka-Volterra(LV) system against what would be expected from a standard Python Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation of Lotka-Volterra employs wolves (predators) and sheep (prey) as model organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our \"partially discretized\" model implementation of the LV system, the continuous curve of the predator population, wolves, is replaced by the use of a model implementation in which wolf \"agents\" are individualized and have discrete, integer population counts at every step. The discrete population notably cannot rebound from a sub-1 value.  The prey population, the sheep, are left to operate as a single population group, with non-discrete (implemented as a floating point number, so our discretion is limited!) populations that can exist at sub-1 counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our \"fully discretized\" model implementation also transitions the prey population to discrete integer counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of discretized systems is widely discussed and debated in simulation and agent-based modeling literature. Our approach is based on a Euler-stepped approach described in the accompanying notebook, `introducing_do_android_wolves.ipynb`. In this notebook we will evaluate the similarities and differences between our novel approach and the values that a solver can generate using the same LV system of equations."
